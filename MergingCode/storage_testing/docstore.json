{value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "The main purpose of introducing CRM is to increase lifetime value (LTV) in the long term.\n\nTo manage (monitor) whether lifetime value is increasing over the long term, information is needed to confirm whether lifetime value per customer (CLV) is increasing year by year.\n\n\n\nThe lifetime value per customer is Customer Life-time The initials of Value ,\n\nIt is abbreviated as CLV.\n\nWe check the information every year to see if this CLV is increasing over the course of one, two, three, four, and five years.\n\n\n\nFor supermarket CLV, the first year will be 30,000 yen.\n\nSecond year CLV increased by 20% to 36,000 yen,\n\nThe third year CLV also increased by 20% to 43,200 yen.\n\nThe main goal of CRM is to increase the value of each customer in this way.\n\n\n\nIf your company has 3,000 online customers,\n\nThe company's profits will be 90 million yen in the first year (CLV 30,000 yen x 3,000 people), 180 million yen in the second year, and 129.6 million yen in the third year.\n\n\n\nIf you look at the rise and fall of customer CLV, you can see that sales promotion activities (marketing activities)\n\nYou can determine the profit situation over the long term, whether it is profitable or not.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease understand that the purpose of introducing and promoting CRM is to \"increase profits stably over the long term.\"\n\nPlease understand that CLV is the most valuable figure for making that decision .\n\n\n\n\n\nPursuing a low price policy will lower CLV.\n\nCLV will rise if the external environment, such as inbound demand, is favorable.\n\nStores in good locations have high CLV numbers.\n\nWhen other companies enter the market, CLV suddenly drops to a low number.\n\n\n\nIn today's world, it is impossible to predict what will happen in the future.\n\nOne of the strategies to solidify our foothold is the pursuit of CRM.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA side note\n\n\n\nA few years ago, a London-based consulting firm conducted a survey of managers of 1,000 European and American companies.\n\n\n\nThe question is, \"Do you know about lifetime value?\"\n\n83% of managers answered \"I don't know.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nFor companies that have implemented CRM\n\nThe question \"Was it successful?\"\n\nOnly 15% answered that it was successful.\n\n\n\nThe reason for its lack of success is that CRM was perceived as a system.\n\n\n\n\n\nCRM (Customer Relationship Management) is a hot topic, and many university professors and consulting firms around the world are saying that CRM needs to be customer-oriented rather than product-oriented.\n\nMany papers have been published stating that CRM is a form of marketing that brings long-term, stable profits to companies.\n\n\n\nHowever, this was not understood, and CRM was considered a system, and was introduced at the expense of hundreds of millions of yen from IBM and other companies, but the failure was due to the lack of attention to customer and human orientation.\n\n\n\nIt was criticized that the failure was due to a failure to understand that this is a marketing technique that appeals to the human emotions of customers.\n\n\n\nCRM is a marketing method that increases customer satisfaction and loyalty.\n\nIt must be learned, understood, and implemented as part of the company's strategy.\n\nCRM is a strategy to improve business performance without being affected by the external environment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[ Requirements for achieving the true purpose]\n\n\n\nBecoming a company that is loved by customers will enable us to achieve long-term profits.\n\nThis is a very difficult challenge.\n\n\n\nHere we will discuss the CRM marketing elements that will help you achieve your goals.\n\nYour customer base consists of new and existing customers.\n\nDepartment stores also have external trade customers, which we have not considered here.\n\n\n\nThe next page , \"Customer Issues,\" explains how new and existing customers affect profit growth.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u3000\n\nAcquiring new customers is an important factor in increasing sales and profits.\n\nThe most important factor is existing customers.\n\n\n\n\n\nExisting customers continue to buy\n\nExisting customers will visit the store more often\n\nIncreased purchase amount from existing customers\n\nExisting customers increasing the number of items they purchase\n\nExisting customers purchasing products with high gross profit margins\n\nNot a customer seeking special offers or other rewards\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf existing customers don't leave and continue to shop,\n\nCLV, the goal of CRM, will continue to rise.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[Customer Issues]\n\n\n\nWe look at the problems your customers have.\n\n\n\n1. Problems with acquiring new customers\n\nDue to population decline, declining birthrate and aging population, and intensifying competition (entry of major retailers from other prefectures, etc.),\n\nAcquiring new customers is a challenge.\n\nYou may think that you are attracting new customers by distributing flyers, but most of the customers who come to your store because of the flyers are existing customers who only come during this sale.\n\nThis is an existing customer who is at the bottom or ninth in the decile analysis (top 10 divisions based on purchase amount).\n\nCLV will increase if the number of new customers increases, but the reality is that this is quite difficult.\n\nEven if you attract customers at extremely low prices, they will leave unless you continue to offer the lowest prices.\n\nWe live in an age where we cannot expect much increase in CLV from new customers.\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Problems with existing customers\n\nExisting customers are divided into the following categories:\n\nThey can be divided into super-valued customers, valued customers, and regular customers.\n\n\"Decile analysis\" is a customer identification method commonly used in supermarkets.\n\nDecile 1 customers are very valuable customers, 2nd and 3rd are best value customers, 4th to 6th deciles are general customers, and 7th deciles and below are reward-oriented customers.\n\n\n\nUsing RFM cell analysis information, AA customers can be classified as very valuable customers, AB customers as valued customers, and AC customers as average customers.\n\n\n\nCRM is a marketing method that develops regular customers into loyal customers and loyal customers into super loyal customers.\n\n\n\n\n\n3. The problem of customer defection\n\nMany regular customers tend to leave.\n\nThe number of customers who leave varies depending on the store and sales area.\n\nMany customers are leaving, with a defection rate of 10% to 30%.\n\nThis churn rate reduces CLV.\n\nOur loyal customers have almost zero churn rate. They keep buying.\n\nThese customers make a significant contribution to the CLV figures.\n\nHere are two important numerical terms:\n\nThis is a number that has a significant impact on the CLV value.\n\n\n\nOne is retention rate\n\nThe other is the churn rate.\n\n\n\nIf there are 1,000 existing customers, and 950 customers will be retained next year, and 50 customers will defect,\n\nOur existing customer retention rate is 95% and our churn rate is 5%.\n\n\n\nFurthermore, the retention rate the following year was 95%.\n\nOf the 950 existing customers, 95%, or 902 people, remain existing customers this year.\n\n48 people defect.\n\n\n\nThis will result in a decline in existing customers.\n\nAs a result, CLV falls.\n\n\n\nIf the churn rate is 20% or 30%, the CLV will be small and will suffer.\n\nThe average defection rate for supermarkets is around 30%.\n\nThe loss of existing customers must be compensated for by acquiring new customers.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is your current customer churn rate (or, conversely, retention rate)?\n\nDo you understand? A 30% increase is a huge blow to long-term profit growth.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are five types of defection rate patterns:\n\n\n\nLong-term customer pattern First year defection rate 5% Next year defection rate 5%\n\nMedium-life customer pattern: First-year defection rate: 25%; second-year defection rate: 10%\n\nFreaky customer pattern First year defection rate 50% Next year defection rate 10%\n\nShort-life customer pattern First year defection rate 50% Next year defection rate 50%\n\nInstantaneous customer lifespan pattern First year churn rate 100%\n\n\n\n\n\nYour company must aim for a long-life customer pattern.\n\nTo do this, you must clearly identify all of your customers.\n\n\u3000\n\n[ Responding to customer issues]\n\n\n\n1. Response to new customer acquisition\n\nIn an era of declining population, a declining birthrate and aging population, and intensifying competition, it is extremely difficult to deal with new customers.\n\nDue to the declining population, local department stores and supermarkets are facing very difficult times.\n\nThere are four possible ways to respond.\n\n\n\nOne is selling at reduced prices, attracting customers with extremely low prices.\n\nLowering prices reduces sales to existing customers, which lowers CLV.\n\nThere is a trade-off between low-price strategies and CLV, so it is not a strategy that should be pursued.\n\n\n\nThe second is to stock products that other companies don't have. Stocking health-conscious and vegan products (completely plant-based products) is one way to attract customers from far away. It's about stocking products that are only available there.\n\nUnder the guidance of a supermarket, we displayed products such as line-caught bonito from Kochi, bran bread from Nagoya, ancient rice cakes from Takamatsu, and dried hijiki seaweed from Uwajima. What surprised us was that two new customers came to the store from 30 kilometers away, and these customers came almost once a week.\n\n\n\nThe third is to get word of mouth from existing customers, very loyal customers, and loyal customers.\n\nTo do this, you need to plan the products, sales methods, and weekday events that will generate word of mouth for your company.\n\n\n\nThe fourth is to utilize social networking sites (SNS) to advertise the products your company handles and attract customers.\n\nDaimaru has organized a dedicated social media department, and the editors are interviewing customers at the Tokyo store. If you keep an eye on TikTok, you can see posts about events like the Hakata Daimaru 75th anniversary event and the Sapporo Daimaru event. However, since social media is advertising, it's unclear whether it's attracting new customers.\n\nIt might be better than doing nothing. I'm thinking of experimenting with using Instagram etc.\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Dealing with existing customers\n\nThere is no distribution industry or retail store that does not have defecting customers.\n\nThis year, there were zero defections. And those same customers will also have zero defections next year. This might be possible in a monopoly market with no other stores, but there is no such business area.\n\nIn a certain supermarket, the defection rate is less than 10% and the sales amount is in the top 30% of the decibel analysis.\n\nI was surprised to see a figure of over 90%.\n\nWhen I asked, I found out that this store was located on top of a small mountain, with no other stores nearby.\n\nThese rare cases are a different story; typically, around 30% to 40% of users leave.\n\nIn other words, the current retention rate seems to be between 60% and 70%.\n\n\n\nNow, you can easily answer the question of what to do to increase CLV in this situation.\n\nYes, that's right.\n\nIt's about reducing your churn rate. If you can improve your churn rate by 10%, your average customer lifetime will increase. It's like a healthy lifespan.\n\n\n\nThe following figures were published in the \"Loyalty Guide\" published by a London-based consulting firm:\n\n\n\nIf the annual retention rate is 50%, the average customer lifetime is 2 years\n\nIf the annual retention rate is 70%, the average customer lifetime is 3.3 years\n\nIf the annual retention rate is 80%, the average customer lifetime is 5 years\n\nIf the annual retention rate is 90%, the average customer lifetime is 10 years.\n\n\n\nIf the customer churn rate is 10% and the retention rate is 90%, this means that existing customers will continue to buy for an average of 10 years. Although the CLV figure is not shown, it will continue to rise.\n\nThe purpose of implementing CRM is to achieve long-term profit growth.\n\nTo maintain a high CLV, it is important to maintain a high customer retention rate and reduce customer churn as much as possible.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is another factor that contributes to increasing CLV.\n\nThis is explained in terms of cross-selling and up-selling.\n\n\n\nCross-selling is related purchasing.\n\nUpselling is getting a customer to buy a higher-grade product.\n\n\n\nIf a customer buys two items at a time, cross-selling means getting them to buy one more item, which increases CLV.\n\nIf the product is the same, you want customers to buy a higher-grade product. This increases CLV.\n\n\n\nIf this can be achieved, the average purchase price per customer will increase.\n\nThis means that CLV will increase.\n\n[How to allocate promotional investments] Who should you invest in to get the CLV effect?\n\n\n\nAllocating the promotional budget. Annual budget planning. Budget allocation is the most important, most difficult to adjust, and most emotional issue.\n\nThe company's traditional budget allocation philosophy remains deeply rooted, making it extremely difficult to allocate budget to implement new strategies.\n\n\n\nThe budget allocation mentioned here is the allocation of the promotional budget.\n\nAdvertising expenses, seasonal event promotion expenses, and monthly flyer expenses are all promotional expenses.\n\nIn this budget planning, aren't you currently requesting a 5% increase on the previous year's budget?\n\nFor example, if 50 million yen is approved, would you use it as an expense within the budget for the fiscal year?\n\nThis is incorrect.\n\n\n\nA promotional budget is not an expense, but an investment that will generate profits.\n\nawareness throughout the company that promotional expenses are not expenses, but rather an \"investment.\" We must stop taking the attitude that anything is possible as long as it is within the budget.\n\nAs I will explain later, as long as it is an investment, how much profit will there be compared to the investment in sales promotion expenses?\n\nThe numerical profit margin calculated by dividing the profit amount by the promotion investment amount. Return on investment (ROI ) On Investment ) value must be indicated in the promotional application.\n\nWe consider the allocation of the promotional budget for promoting CRM implementation as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1. Allocating budget to acquiring new customers\n\n\n\nHe said that currently, acquiring new customers is a challenge.\n\nInvestment in acquiring new customers will be difficult to justify.\n\nYou think that flyer advertising will help you acquire new customers, but it is not effective at all. You need to think of a different way.\n\n\n\nOn page 6, we outlined four ideas for acquiring new customers.\n\nDecide which of these four you will implement, or whether to do all four, and create a budget allocation for the investments you will make. You will also predict the ROI figure.\n\n\n\nBudget allocation for relationship-strengthening promotional investments and special offers to retain customers\n\n\n\nThere is a lot of value in investing in existing customers. We set goals such as increasing customer retention rates by 10% and invest accordingly. However, not all existing customers are worth investing in.\n\nFrom the RFM cell information, the AA group of highly valued customers and the AB group of highly valued customers have the highest investment value. The investment value of the AC group of general customers (the group with the largest number of customers in the entire group) is very small.\n\n\n\nWhen it comes to investing, our experience shows that thank you letters are a worthwhile investment for department stores. For supermarkets, our recommended campaign of \"Get a discount sticker when you stick it on\" is highly popular with customers and highly worthwhile for existing customers who have a redistricting of 3 or more (based on a decile analysis).\n\n\n\nThere is one more thing I would like you to do with an emphasis on existing customers.\n\na word-of-mouth promotion .\n\nThe idea is to sell \"products that will spread word of mouth\" to the customers in the AA and AB groups of top value customers, and to plan \"sales promotions that will spread word of mouth.\" It doesn't require much investment. It all depends on your ideas.\n\nIf you don't provide something that will garner word of mouth, you won't get word of mouth. Word of mouth is the most effective form of free advertising, so please discuss your ideas with everyone. Word of mouth is an excellent promotional method for acquiring new customers who are difficult to attract.\n\nI've heard that in Europe and the US, there are specialized departments that promote word-of-mouth. That's how important the marketing method is. It will likely be spread to a large number of people on social networking sites (SNS).\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Allocating budget to bring back lapsed customers\n\n\n\nIt's not worth the investment. Chasing away customers is a waste of time.\n\nIt's like trying to persuade your ex-wife to come back.\n\n\n\nThere is just one way of thinking.\n\nComplete customer defection is a waste, but it is an investment to prevent customers who show signs of defection from defecting .\n\n\n\nIf it's been 90 days since the last purchase at a department store, it's a sign of defection. If it's been a year, the customer is completely defected and there's no chance of them coming back.\n\nIf we run a comeback campaign for RFM Cell's very best customers, the BA group, who are showing signs of defecting, and for best customers, the BB group, who are showing signs of defecting, nearly half of them tend to return (comeback experience).\n\nIf you're a supermarket, you might be able to attract customers who have been shopping with you for more than 30 days but not yet 50 days by offering them discount stickers. If it's been more than 60 days (without buying groceries at your store), they've probably moved or started shopping at another store. Investing in these customers is a waste.\n\n\n\nFrom a CLV perspective, customer churn lowers CLV. Therefore, you should take measures to prevent churn as soon as there are signs of churn.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs mentioned above, promotional expenses, advertising expenses, event expenses, etc. should not be considered as expenses but as customer investments, and you should consider who to invest in to effectively generate profits and then consider how to allocate your promotional investments.\n\n\n\nIt's the same as investing in stocks.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs I have said many times before, promotional expenses are not an expense. They are an investment.\n\nSince it is an investment, it is natural business practice to check the numbers to see how much profit you have made from your investment.\n\n\n\nIt is completely unclear how much profit the newspaper advertisements and flyers brought in.\n\nI believe that we are no longer in an era where business is so easy that it would be possible to do something like this.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[ Product strategy to attract customers]\n\nLet's consider product strategies that affect marketing activities from a CRM perspective.\n\nThis is a marketing strategy that merchandisers (whose main job is to plan product lineups) and buyers (whose main job is to procure products based on product lineup plans) are currently completely unaware of.\n\nWe will explain what product strategy from CRM is.\n\n\n\n\n\n1. Product strategy aimed at acquiring new customers\n\nI don't think it really qualifies as a strategy, but it's such an important consideration that I've decided to call it a strategy.\n\nProduct strategies to attract new customers. We negotiate products that will spread word of mouth and attract customers from far away, and then display them in each store and sales floor.\n\nIn supermarkets, some good products include Kochi's line-caught bonito tataki (conveniently stored in the refrigerator as it is a frozen food) and Osawa Japan's germinated brown rice cream. Osawa Japan is a company that develops products for vegetarians. They have many products that are beneficial to the health of consumers. Set up a vegetarian section.\n\nDepartment stores will set up vegan product shops, selling shoes, bags, belts, coats, and other clothing items that are not made from materials that involve animal cruelty. This is an appeal to animal ethics.\n\nWe will introduce products that cannot be purchased at other stores and products that can only be purchased here.\n\n\n\n2. Product strategies to increase customer retention\n\nIn a supermarket, each department has a product that has a high repeat purchase rate. This product can be positioned as a star product, and promotional investments can be made to let customers who have not yet purchased it know about it.\n\nIn department stores, branded products such as Hermes are purchased repeatedly. By frequently contacting the RFM cell of frequently purchasing branded products in the department store, the AA group of highly valued customers, and the AB group of highly valued customers, we can deepen our relationships. We develop general customers into valued customers, and valued customers into highly valued customers. These efforts will increase CLV.\n\n\n\n3. Cross-selling and upselling product strategies\n\nBooks by the same author and music by the same composer are cross-sold products. Plastic train models that you can enjoy by expanding are also cross-sold products.\n\nWe will pursue cross-selling (related purchases) and check the current situation, such as creating a sales floor and display location that encourages sales of related products, and consider ways to increase cross-selling sales.\n\nIf you can cross-sell and up-sell (guide customers to purchase better products), the average purchase price of existing customers will increase, leading to an increase in CLV.\n\n4. Product display strategies that spread word of mouth\n\nOn page 6, I mentioned four ideas for acquiring new customers, one of which is word of mouth.\n\nThe term \"oshikatsu\" (supporting one's favorite product) is currently popular, and it involves considering, introducing, and displaying favorite products.\n\nAs mentioned in the new customer product strategy, department stores will set up shops selling vegan ingredients. Vegan products are hard to find, so if your company sets up a shop, there is a high chance that customers will come from more than 50 kilometers away, which will help you acquire new customers.\n\nAlthough they may be purchasing online, if there is a sales area where they can see the actual product and shop in person, new customers will come to the store, increasing sales volume and sales amount. This will increase CLV.\n\nA vegan shop where you can buy products in person. Word of mouth will spread. Your store or sales area could spread at 100 kilometers per hour on social networking sites.\n\n\n\nIf supermarkets also stock vegan foods, it will become a hot topic among vegetarians and customers who follow a vegan lifestyle, and word of mouth will spread.\n\n\n\nWaitrose, a supermarket chain with 125 stores in London and a supplier to the Royal Family, has set up a vegan product section in every store. Tesco and Sainsbury's, the number one and number two supermarkets in the UK, also have vegan products on display. Carrefour in France also has vegan products on display.\n\nNearly 20% of the population is vegetarian, so it is becoming common to stock vegan products, a recent trend in the West.\n\n\n\n\n\n5. Product Strategy for Customer Comeback\n\nCompletely churn customers are not worth investing in.\n\nWhat should be considered is a sales floor strategy and product strategy to bring back customers who have been with us for more than 30 days in the case of supermarkets, or more than 90 days in the case of department stores, or customers who are prone to defection.\n\n\n\nWe believe that introducing products that can only be purchased at this store to customers in the 4th to 6th decibel range will lead to a comeback, and this is one comeback product strategy.\n\nSupermarkets can also utilize RFM cell information, so we hope that they will try to use this information to make comeback investments in intermediate loyal customers who are showing signs of defecting from the BB group.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[ Customer Investment Strategy CIM Theory]\n\n\n\nWe will abandon the current view of promotional expenses as expenses and make a paradigm shift to view them as an investment strategy for customers. Paradigm means norms.\n\n\n\nConsider which types of customers you should invest in to get the highest return on investment (ROI), and invest in customers with the same mindset as investing in stocks. This is the CRM approach, and the way to determine whether you are achieving long-term profits is to check whether your CLV figures are trending high.\n\nCIM involves identifying customers and allocating budgets to each customer.\n\n\n\nThis promotional investment strategy is called Customer Investment Management. Its abbreviation is CIM. It stands for Customer Investment Management.\n\n\n\nCustomer marketing fund investment management, a concept of measuring the effectiveness of customer marketing fund investment.\n\n\n\nFor each promotion or event you run, this is a system that evaluates which promotions were profitable and which were in the red (loss) in relation to the investment of funds.\n\n\n\n\n\nCIM is a scientific method of customer strategy and a tactic that delivers results.\n\nCIM is a theory that allows optimal allocation of customer budgets.\n\nCIM is a management methodology that produces investment results that bring benefits to the client's budget rather than costs.\n\n\n\nCustomer investment management requires three decision-making metrics:\n\nThere are three important decisions to make:\n\n\n\nWhat should the customer investment budget level be?\n\nHow much of the customer investment budget should be allocated?\n\nMeasuring customer investment productivity and results with ROI\n\n\n\nROI ( Return On Investment ).\n\n\n\nThe passing mark is an ROI of 35%.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[CRM CLV CIM RFM important relationships]\n\n\n\nCRM is a marketing technique that increases long-term profits and increases profits as the years of operation progress.\n\n\n\nCLV is a figure that evaluates whether profits are expanding each year.\n\nCLV is the lifetime value per customer.\n\nIf CLV is increasing, it can be said that earning power is increasing year by year.\n\n\n\nFactors that increase CLV include acquiring new customers, maintaining existing customers, and preventing customer defection.\n\nThere are four elements to increasing the average purchase price per customer.\n\n\n\nCIM Customer Investment Management is the investment in acquiring new customers, maintaining existing customer retention rates, and increasing the average purchase price per customer.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo maintain a high ROI on customer investments,\n\nYou need to find out who you can invest in to get the highest return.\n\n\n\n\n\nRFM cell code analysis is the information that helps you determine who to invest in to get effective results.\n\nJust like with stock investment, information on which stocks to invest in and information from all angles is widely available.\n\n\n\nHowever, there is no widespread information on who to invest in to increase profits.\n\n\n\nRFM is a concept that is spreading worldwide.\n\nHowever, after using the US model (package), we felt that this was insufficient, and so far the RFM cell code information we developed has not been seen anywhere in the world.\n\n\n\nRFM cell information is extremely effective in identifying effective customers, such as those who are extremely valuable, those who are valued, those who are likely to defect, and those who have completely defected.\n\n\n\nBy using RFM cell information to invest in customers, you can achieve a high ROI, which, in turn, can lead to high CLV and increased long-term profits.\n\n\n\n[Reference information]\n\n\n\nHow to calculate CLV: A simple example\n\n\n\nSpecialty store/bakery chain CLV\n\nHow is CLV calculated? A sample is shown.\n\n\n\nThe calculation is based on the first year and then the second, third, and so on for that customer.\n\nThe figures shown in the table are based on the following assumptions:\n\n\n\nNumber of purchasing customers in one year: 45,000\n\nRetention rate (customer retention rate) 65% in the first year\n\nAnnual purchase amount per person (average) 2,500 yen\n\nThe annual purchase amount per person in the next fiscal year will be 105% of the previous year\n\nAverage product cost rate: 50%\n\nPromotional expenses are 3% of sales amount\n\nDiscount rate (depreciation of assets) 1%\n\nNetPro Foot Value NPV is total profit divided by discount rate\n\nCumulative NPV is the cumulative total for each fiscal year\n\nCLV is cumulative NPV divided by the number of customers in the first year (it can also be divided by the number of customers each year).\n\n\n\nCalculating from the above figures, the CLV per customer of a bakery chain is:\n\n1,175 yen in the first year, 1,843 yen in the second year, and 2,223 yen in the third year.\n\nThis is an increase of 1.9 times compared to the first year.\n\nCLV changes depending on retention rate and purchase amount per person.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n\n6", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 28848, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template":

{value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "The main purpose of introducing CRM is to increase lifetime value (LTV) in the long term.\n\nTo manage (monitor) whether lifetime value is increasing over the long term, information is needed to confirm whether lifetime value per customer (CLV) is increasing year by year.\n\n\n\nThe lifetime value per customer is Customer Life-time The initials of Value ,\n\nIt is abbreviated as CLV.\n\nWe check the information every year to see if this CLV is increasing over the course of one, two, three, four, and five years.\n\n\n\nFor supermarket CLV, the first year will be 30,000 yen.\n\nSecond year CLV increased by 20% to 36,000 yen,\n\nThe third year CLV also increased by 20% to 43,200 yen.\n\nThe main goal of CRM is to increase the value of each customer in this way.\n\n\n\nIf your company has 3,000 online customers,\n\nThe company's profits will be 90 million yen in the first year (CLV 30,000 yen x 3,000 people), 180 million yen in the second year, and 129.6 million yen in the third year.\n\n\n\nIf you look at the rise and fall of customer CLV, you can see that sales promotion activities (marketing activities)\n\nYou can determine the profit situation over the long term, whether it is profitable or not.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease understand that the purpose of introducing and promoting CRM is to \"increase profits stably over the long term.\"\n\nPlease understand that CLV is the most valuable figure for making that decision .\n\n\n\n\n\nPursuing a low price policy will lower CLV.\n\nCLV will rise if the external environment, such as inbound demand, is favorable.\n\nStores in good locations have high CLV numbers.\n\nWhen other companies enter the market, CLV suddenly drops to a low number.\n\n\n\nIn today's world, it is impossible to predict what will happen in the future.\n\nOne of the strategies to solidify our foothold is the pursuit of CRM.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA side note\n\n\n\nA few years ago, a London-based consulting firm conducted a survey of managers of 1,000 European and American companies.\n\n\n\nThe question is, \"Do you know about lifetime value?\"\n\n83% of managers answered \"I don't know.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nFor companies that have implemented CRM\n\nThe question \"Was it successful?\"\n\nOnly 15% answered that it was successful.\n\n\n\nThe reason for its lack of success is that CRM was perceived as a system.\n\n\n\n\n\nCRM (Customer Relationship Management) is a hot topic, and many university professors and consulting firms around the world are saying that CRM needs to be customer-oriented rather than product-oriented.\n\nMany papers have been published stating that CRM is a form of marketing that brings long-term, stable profits to companies.\n\n\n\nHowever, this was not understood, and CRM was considered a system, and was introduced at the expense of hundreds of millions of yen from IBM and other companies, but the failure was due to the lack of attention to customer and human orientation.\n\n\n\nIt was criticized that the failure was due to a failure to understand that this is a marketing technique that appeals to the human emotions of customers.\n\n\n\nCRM is a marketing method that increases customer satisfaction and loyalty.\n\nIt must be learned, understood, and implemented as part of the company's strategy.\n\nCRM is a strategy to improve business performance without being affected by the external environment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[ Requirements for achieving the true purpose]\n\n\n\nBecoming a company that is loved by customers will enable us to achieve long-term profits.\n\nThis is a very difficult challenge.\n\n\n\nHere we will discuss the CRM marketing elements that will help you achieve your goals.\n\nYour customer base consists of new and existing customers.\n\nDepartment stores also have external trade customers, which we have not considered here.\n\n\n\nThe next page , \"Customer Issues,\" explains how new and existing customers affect profit growth.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u3000\n\nAcquiring new customers is an important factor in increasing sales and profits.\n\nThe most important factor is existing customers.\n\n\n\n\n\nExisting customers continue to buy\n\nExisting customers will visit the store more often\n\nIncreased purchase amount from existing customers\n\nExisting customers increasing the number of items they purchase\n\nExisting customers purchasing products with high gross profit margins\n\nNot a customer seeking special offers or other rewards\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf existing customers don't leave and continue to shop,\n\nCLV, the goal of CRM, will continue to rise.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[Customer Issues]\n\n\n\nWe look at the problems your customers have.\n\n\n\n1. Problems with acquiring new customers\n\nDue to population decline, declining birthrate and aging population, and intensifying competition (entry of major retailers from other prefectures, etc.),\n\nAcquiring new customers is a challenge.\n\nYou may think that you are attracting new customers by distributing flyers, but most of the customers who come to your store because of the flyers are existing customers who only come during this sale.\n\nThis is an existing customer who is at the bottom or ninth in the decile analysis (top 10 divisions based on purchase amount).\n\nCLV will increase if the number of new customers increases, but the reality is that this is quite difficult.\n\nEven if you attract customers at extremely low prices, they will leave unless you continue to offer the lowest prices.\n\nWe live in an age where we cannot expect much increase in CLV from new customers.\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Problems with existing customers\n\nExisting customers are divided into the following categories:\n\nThey can be divided into super-valued customers, valued customers, and regular customers.\n\n\"Decile analysis\" is a customer identification method commonly used in supermarkets.\n\nDecile 1 customers are very valuable customers, 2nd and 3rd are best value customers, 4th to 6th deciles are general customers, and 7th deciles and below are reward-oriented customers.\n\n\n\nUsing RFM cell analysis information, AA customers can be classified as very valuable customers, AB customers as valued customers, and AC customers as average customers.\n\n\n\nCRM is a marketing method that develops regular customers into loyal customers and loyal customers into super loyal customers.\n\n\n\n\n\n3. The problem of customer defection\n\nMany regular customers tend to leave.\n\nThe number of customers who leave varies depending on the store and sales area.\n\nMany customers are leaving, with a defection rate of 10% to 30%.\n\nThis churn rate reduces CLV.\n\nOur loyal customers have almost zero churn rate. They keep buying.\n\nThese customers make a significant contribution to the CLV figures.\n\nHere are two important numerical terms:\n\nThis is a number that has a significant impact on the CLV value.\n\n\n\nOne is retention rate\n\nThe other is the churn rate.\n\n\n\nIf there are 1,000 existing customers, and 950 customers will be retained next year, and 50 customers will defect,\n\nOur existing customer retention rate is 95% and our churn rate is 5%.\n\n\n\nFurthermore, the retention rate the following year was 95%.\n\nOf the 950 existing customers, 95%, or 902 people, remain existing customers this year.\n\n48 people defect.\n\n\n\nThis will result in a decline in existing customers.\n\nAs a result, CLV falls.\n\n\n\nIf the churn rate is 20% or 30%, the CLV will be small and will suffer.\n\nThe average defection rate for supermarkets is around 30%.\n\nThe loss of existing customers must be compensated for by acquiring new customers.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is your current customer churn rate (or, conversely, retention rate)?\n\nDo you understand? A 30% increase is a huge blow to long-term profit growth.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are five types of defection rate patterns:\n\n\n\nLong-term customer pattern First year defection rate 5% Next year defection rate 5%\n\nMedium-life customer pattern: First-year defection rate: 25%; second-year defection rate: 10%\n\nFreaky customer pattern First year defection rate 50% Next year defection rate 10%\n\nShort-life customer pattern First year defection rate 50% Next year defection rate 50%\n\nInstantaneous customer lifespan pattern First year churn rate 100%\n\n\n\n\n\nYour company must aim for a long-life customer pattern.\n\nTo do this, you must clearly identify all of your customers.\n\n\u3000\n\n[ Responding to customer issues]\n\n\n\n1. Response to new customer acquisition\n\nIn an era of declining population, a declining birthrate and aging population, and intensifying competition, it is extremely difficult to deal with new customers.\n\nDue to the declining population, local department stores and supermarkets are facing very difficult times.\n\nThere are four possible ways to respond.\n\n\n\nOne is selling at reduced prices, attracting customers with extremely low prices.\n\nLowering prices reduces sales to existing customers, which lowers CLV.\n\nThere is a trade-off between low-price strategies and CLV, so it is not a strategy that should be pursued.\n\n\n\nThe second is to stock products that other companies don't have. Stocking health-conscious and vegan products (completely plant-based products) is one way to attract customers from far away. It's about stocking products that are only available there.\n\nUnder the guidance of a supermarket, we displayed products such as line-caught bonito from Kochi, bran bread from Nagoya, ancient rice cakes from Takamatsu, and dried hijiki seaweed from Uwajima. What surprised us was that two new customers came to the store from 30 kilometers away, and these customers came almost once a week.\n\n\n\nThe third is to get word of mouth from existing customers, very loyal customers, and loyal customers.\n\nTo do this, you need to plan the products, sales methods, and weekday events that will generate word of mouth for your company.\n\n\n\nThe fourth is to utilize social networking sites (SNS) to advertise the products your company handles and attract customers.\n\nDaimaru has organized a dedicated social media department, and the editors are interviewing customers at the Tokyo store. If you keep an eye on TikTok, you can see posts about events like the Hakata Daimaru 75th anniversary event and the Sapporo Daimaru event. However, since social media is advertising, it's unclear whether it's attracting new customers.\n\nIt might be better than doing nothing. I'm thinking of experimenting with using Instagram etc.\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Dealing with existing customers\n\nThere is no distribution industry or retail store that does not have defecting customers.\n\nThis year, there were zero defections. And those same customers will also have zero defections next year. This might be possible in a monopoly market with no other stores, but there is no such business area.\n\nIn a certain supermarket, the defection rate is less than 10% and the sales amount is in the top 30% of the decibel analysis.\n\nI was surprised to see a figure of over 90%.\n\nWhen I asked, I found out that this store was located on top of a small mountain, with no other stores nearby.\n\nThese rare cases are a different story; typically, around 30% to 40% of users leave.\n\nIn other words, the current retention rate seems to be between 60% and 70%.\n\n\n\nNow, you can easily answer the question of what to do to increase CLV in this situation.\n\nYes, that's right.\n\nIt's about reducing your churn rate. If you can improve your churn rate by 10%, your average customer lifetime will increase. It's like a healthy lifespan.\n\n\n\nThe following figures were published in the \"Loyalty Guide\" published by a London-based consulting firm:\n\n\n\nIf the annual retention rate is 50%, the average customer lifetime is 2 years\n\nIf the annual retention rate is 70%, the average customer lifetime is 3.3 years\n\nIf the annual retention rate is 80%, the average customer lifetime is 5 years\n\nIf the annual retention rate is 90%, the average customer lifetime is 10 years.\n\n\n\nIf the customer churn rate is 10% and the retention rate is 90%, this means that existing customers will continue to buy for an average of 10 years. Although the CLV figure is not shown, it will continue to rise.\n\nThe purpose of implementing CRM is to achieve long-term profit growth.\n\nTo maintain a high CLV, it is important to maintain a high customer retention rate and reduce customer churn as much as possible.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is another factor that contributes to increasing CLV.\n\nThis is explained in terms of cross-selling and up-selling.\n\n\n\nCross-selling is related purchasing.\n\nUpselling is getting a customer to buy a higher-grade product.\n\n\n\nIf a customer buys two items at a time, cross-selling means getting them to buy one more item, which increases CLV.\n\nIf the product is the same, you want customers to buy a higher-grade product. This increases CLV.\n\n\n\nIf this can be achieved, the average purchase price per customer will increase.\n\nThis means that CLV will increase.\n\n[How to allocate promotional investments] Who should you invest in to get the CLV effect?\n\n\n\nAllocating the promotional budget. Annual budget planning. Budget allocation is the most important, most difficult to adjust, and most emotional issue.\n\nThe company's traditional budget allocation philosophy remains deeply rooted, making it extremely difficult to allocate budget to implement new strategies.\n\n\n\nThe budget allocation mentioned here is the allocation of the promotional budget.\n\nAdvertising expenses, seasonal event promotion expenses, and monthly flyer expenses are all promotional expenses.\n\nIn this budget planning, aren't you currently requesting a 5% increase on the previous year's budget?\n\nFor example, if 50 million yen is approved, would you use it as an expense within the budget for the fiscal year?\n\nThis is incorrect.\n\n\n\nA promotional budget is not an expense, but an investment that will generate profits.\n\nawareness throughout the company that promotional expenses are not expenses, but rather an \"investment.\" We must stop taking the attitude that anything is possible as long as it is within the budget.\n\nAs I will explain later, as long as it is an investment, how much profit will there be compared to the investment in sales promotion expenses?\n\nThe numerical profit margin calculated by dividing the profit amount by the promotion investment amount. Return on investment (ROI ) On Investment ) value must be indicated in the promotional application.\n\nWe consider the allocation of the promotional budget for promoting CRM implementation as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1. Allocating budget to acquiring new customers\n\n\n\nHe said that currently, acquiring new customers is a challenge.\n\nInvestment in acquiring new customers will be difficult to justify.\n\nYou think that flyer advertising will help you acquire new customers, but it is not effective at all. You need to think of a different way.\n\n\n\nOn page 6, we outlined four ideas for acquiring new customers.\n\nDecide which of these four you will implement, or whether to do all four, and create a budget allocation for the investments you will make. You will also predict the ROI figure.\n\n\n\nBudget allocation for relationship-strengthening promotional investments and special offers to retain customers\n\n\n\nThere is a lot of value in investing in existing customers. We set goals such as increasing customer retention rates by 10% and invest accordingly. However, not all existing customers are worth investing in.\n\nFrom the RFM cell information, the AA group of highly valued customers and the AB group of highly valued customers have the highest investment value. The investment value of the AC group of general customers (the group with the largest number of customers in the entire group) is very small.\n\n\n\nWhen it comes to investing, our experience shows that thank you letters are a worthwhile investment for department stores. For supermarkets, our recommended campaign of \"Get a discount sticker when you stick it on\" is highly popular with customers and highly worthwhile for existing customers who have a redistricting of 3 or more (based on a decile analysis).\n\n\n\nThere is one more thing I would like you to do with an emphasis on existing customers.\n\na word-of-mouth promotion .\n\nThe idea is to sell \"products that will spread word of mouth\" to the customers in the AA and AB groups of top value customers, and to plan \"sales promotions that will spread word of mouth.\" It doesn't require much investment. It all depends on your ideas.\n\nIf you don't provide something that will garner word of mouth, you won't get word of mouth. Word of mouth is the most effective form of free advertising, so please discuss your ideas with everyone. Word of mouth is an excellent promotional method for acquiring new customers who are difficult to attract.\n\nI've heard that in Europe and the US, there are specialized departments that promote word-of-mouth. That's how important the marketing method is. It will likely be spread to a large number of people on social networking sites (SNS).\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Allocating budget to bring back lapsed customers\n\n\n\nIt's not worth the investment. Chasing away customers is a waste of time.\n\nIt's like trying to persuade your ex-wife to come back.\n\n\n\nThere is just one way of thinking.\n\nComplete customer defection is a waste, but it is an investment to prevent customers who show signs of defection from defecting .\n\n\n\nIf it's been 90 days since the last purchase at a department store, it's a sign of defection. If it's been a year, the customer is completely defected and there's no chance of them coming back.\n\nIf we run a comeback campaign for RFM Cell's very best customers, the BA group, who are showing signs of defecting, and for best customers, the BB group, who are showing signs of defecting, nearly half of them tend to return (comeback experience).\n\nIf you're a supermarket, you might be able to attract customers who have been shopping with you for more than 30 days but not yet 50 days by offering them discount stickers. If it's been more than 60 days (without buying groceries at your store), they've probably moved or started shopping at another store. Investing in these customers is a waste.\n\n\n\nFrom a CLV perspective, customer churn lowers CLV. Therefore, you should take measures to prevent churn as soon as there are signs of churn.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs mentioned above, promotional expenses, advertising expenses, event expenses, etc. should not be considered as expenses but as customer investments, and you should consider who to invest in to effectively generate profits and then consider how to allocate your promotional investments.\n\n\n\nIt's the same as investing in stocks.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs I have said many times before, promotional expenses are not an expense. They are an investment.\n\nSince it is an investment, it is natural business practice to check the numbers to see how much profit you have made from your investment.\n\n\n\nIt is completely unclear how much profit the newspaper advertisements and flyers brought in.\n\nI believe that we are no longer in an era where business is so easy that it would be possible to do something like this.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[ Product strategy to attract customers]\n\nLet's consider product strategies that affect marketing activities from a CRM perspective.\n\nThis is a marketing strategy that merchandisers (whose main job is to plan product lineups) and buyers (whose main job is to procure products based on product lineup plans) are currently completely unaware of.\n\nWe will explain what product strategy from CRM is.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 19143, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name":

to attract customers]\n\nLet's consider product strategies that affect marketing activities from a CRM perspective.\n\nThis is a marketing strategy that merchandisers (whose main job is to plan product lineups) and buyers (whose main job is to procure products based on product lineup plans) are currently completely unaware of.\n\nWe will explain what product strategy from CRM is.\n\n\n\n\n\n1. Product strategy aimed at acquiring new customers\n\nI don't think it really qualifies as a strategy, but it's such an important consideration that I've decided to call it a strategy.\n\nProduct strategies to attract new customers. We negotiate products that will spread word of mouth and attract customers from far away, and then display them in each store and sales floor.\n\nIn supermarkets, some good products include Kochi's line-caught bonito tataki (conveniently stored in the refrigerator as it is a frozen food) and Osawa Japan's germinated brown rice cream. Osawa Japan is a company that develops products for vegetarians. They have many products that are beneficial to the health of consumers. Set up a vegetarian section.\n\nDepartment stores will set up vegan product shops, selling shoes, bags, belts, coats, and other clothing items that are not made from materials that involve animal cruelty. This is an appeal to animal ethics.\n\nWe will introduce products that cannot be purchased at other stores and products that can only be purchased here.\n\n\n\n2. Product strategies to increase customer retention\n\nIn a supermarket, each department has a product that has a high repeat purchase rate. This product can be positioned as a star product, and promotional investments can be made to let customers who have not yet purchased it know about it.\n\nIn department stores, branded products such as Hermes are purchased repeatedly. By frequently contacting the RFM cell of frequently purchasing branded products in the department store, the AA group of highly valued customers, and the AB group of highly valued customers, we can deepen our relationships. We develop general customers into valued customers, and valued customers into highly valued customers. These efforts will increase CLV.\n\n\n\n3. Cross-selling and upselling product strategies\n\nBooks by the same author and music by the same composer are cross-sold products. Plastic train models that you can enjoy by expanding are also cross-sold products.\n\nWe will pursue cross-selling (related purchases) and check the current situation, such as creating a sales floor and display location that encourages sales of related products, and consider ways to increase cross-selling sales.\n\nIf you can cross-sell and up-sell (guide customers to purchase better products), the average purchase price of existing customers will increase, leading to an increase in CLV.\n\n4. Product display strategies that spread word of mouth\n\nOn page 6, I mentioned four ideas for acquiring new customers, one of which is word of mouth.\n\nThe term \"oshikatsu\" (supporting one's favorite product) is currently popular, and it involves considering, introducing, and displaying favorite products.\n\nAs mentioned in the new customer product strategy, department stores will set up shops selling vegan ingredients. Vegan products are hard to find, so if your company sets up a shop, there is a high chance that customers will come from more than 50 kilometers away, which will help you acquire new customers.\n\nAlthough they may be purchasing online, if there is a sales area where they can see the actual product and shop in person, new customers will come to the store, increasing sales volume and sales amount. This will increase CLV.\n\nA vegan shop where you can buy products in person. Word of mouth will spread. Your store or sales area could spread at 100 kilometers per hour on social networking sites.\n\n\n\nIf supermarkets also stock vegan foods, it will become a hot topic among vegetarians and customers who follow a vegan lifestyle, and word of mouth will spread.\n\n\n\nWaitrose, a supermarket chain with 125 stores in London and a supplier to the Royal Family, has set up a vegan product section in every store. Tesco and Sainsbury's, the number one and number two supermarkets in the UK, also have vegan products on display. Carrefour in France also has vegan products on display.\n\nNearly 20% of the population is vegetarian, so it is becoming common to stock vegan products, a recent trend in the West.\n\n\n\n\n\n5. Product Strategy for Customer Comeback\n\nCompletely churn customers are not worth investing in.\n\nWhat should be considered is a sales floor strategy and product strategy to bring back customers who have been with us for more than 30 days in the case of supermarkets, or more than 90 days in the case of department stores, or customers who are prone to defection.\n\n\n\nWe believe that introducing products that can only be purchased at this store to customers in the 4th to 6th decibel range will lead to a comeback, and this is one comeback product strategy.\n\nSupermarkets can also utilize RFM cell information, so we hope that they will try to use this information to make comeback investments in intermediate loyal customers who are showing signs of defecting from the BB group.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[ Customer Investment Strategy CIM Theory]\n\n\n\nWe will abandon the current view of promotional expenses as expenses and make a paradigm shift to view them as an investment strategy for customers. Paradigm means norms.\n\n\n\nConsider which types of customers you should invest in to get the highest return on investment (ROI), and invest in customers with the same mindset as investing in stocks. This is the CRM approach, and the way to determine whether you are achieving long-term profits is to check whether your CLV figures are trending high.\n\nCIM involves identifying customers and allocating budgets to each customer.\n\n\n\nThis promotional investment strategy is called Customer Investment Management. Its abbreviation is CIM. It stands for Customer Investment Management.\n\n\n\nCustomer marketing fund investment management, a concept of measuring the effectiveness of customer marketing fund investment.\n\n\n\nFor each promotion or event you run, this is a system that evaluates which promotions were profitable and which were in the red (loss) in relation to the investment of funds.\n\n\n\n\n\nCIM is a scientific method of customer strategy and a tactic that delivers results.\n\nCIM is a theory that allows optimal allocation of customer budgets.\n\nCIM is a management methodology that produces investment results that bring benefits to the client's budget rather than costs.\n\n\n\nCustomer investment management requires three decision-making metrics:\n\nThere are three important decisions to make:\n\n\n\nWhat should the customer investment budget level be?\n\nHow much of the customer investment budget should be allocated?\n\nMeasuring customer investment productivity and results with ROI\n\n\n\nROI ( Return On Investment ).\n\n\n\nThe passing mark is an ROI of 35%.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[CRM CLV CIM RFM important relationships]\n\n\n\nCRM is a marketing technique that increases long-term profits and increases profits as the years of operation progress.\n\n\n\nCLV is a figure that evaluates whether profits are expanding each year.\n\nCLV is the lifetime value per customer.\n\nIf CLV is increasing, it can be said that earning power is increasing year by year.\n\n\n\nFactors that increase CLV include acquiring new customers, maintaining existing customers, and preventing customer defection.\n\nThere are four elements to increasing the average purchase price per customer.\n\n\n\nCIM Customer Investment Management is the investment in acquiring new customers, maintaining existing customer retention rates, and increasing the average purchase price per customer.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo maintain a high ROI on customer investments,\n\nYou need to find out who you can invest in to get the highest return.\n\n\n\n\n\nRFM cell code analysis is the information that helps you determine who to invest in to get effective results.\n\nJust like with stock investment, information on which stocks to invest in and information from all angles is widely available.\n\n\n\nHowever, there is no widespread information on who to invest in to increase profits.\n\n\n\nRFM is a concept that is spreading worldwide.\n\nHowever, after using the US model (package), we felt that this was insufficient, and so far the RFM cell code information we developed has not been seen anywhere in the world.\n\n\n\nRFM cell information is extremely effective in identifying effective customers, such as those who are extremely valuable, those who are valued, those who are likely to defect, and those who have completely defected.\n\n\n\nBy using RFM cell information to invest in customers, you can achieve a high ROI, which, in turn, can lead to high CLV and increased long-term profits.\n\n\n\n[Reference information]\n\n\n\nHow to calculate CLV: A simple example\n\n\n\nSpecialty store/bakery chain CLV\n\nHow is CLV calculated? A sample is shown.\n\n\n\nThe calculation is based on the first year and then the second, third, and so on for that customer.\n\nThe figures shown in the table are based on the following assumptions:\n\n\n\nNumber of purchasing customers in one year: 45,000\n\nRetention rate (customer retention rate) 65% in the first year\n\nAnnual purchase amount per person (average) 2,500 yen\n\nThe annual purchase amount per person in the next fiscal year will be 105% of the previous year\n\nAverage product cost rate: 50%\n\nPromotional expenses are 3% of sales amount\n\nDiscount rate (depreciation of assets) 1%\n\nNetPro Foot Value NPV is total profit divided by discount rate\n\nCumulative NPV is the cumulative total for each fiscal year\n\nCLV is cumulative NPV divided by the number of customers in the first year (it can also be divided by the number of customers each year).\n\n\n\nCalculating from the above figures, the CLV per customer of a bakery chain is:\n\n1,175 yen in the first year, 1,843 yen in the second year, and 2,223 yen in the third year.\n\nThis is an increase of 1.9 times compared to the first year.\n\nCLV changes depending on retention rate and purchase amount per person.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n\n6", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 18748, "end_char_idx": 28848, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template":

to solidify our foothold is the pursuit of CRM.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA side note\n\n\n\nA few years ago, a London-based consulting firm conducted a survey of managers of 1,000 European and American companies.\n\n\n\nThe question is, \"Do you know about lifetime value?\"\n\n83% of managers answered \"I don't know.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nFor companies that have implemented CRM\n\nThe question \"Was it successful?\"\n\nOnly 15% answered that it was successful.\n\n\n\nThe reason for its lack of success is that CRM was perceived as a system.\n\n\n\n\n\nCRM (Customer Relationship Management) is a hot topic, and many university professors and consulting firms around the world are saying that CRM needs to be customer-oriented rather than product-oriented.\n\nMany papers have been published stating that CRM is a form of marketing that brings long-term, stable profits to companies.\n\n\n\nHowever, this was not understood, and CRM was considered a system, and was introduced at the expense of hundreds of millions of yen from IBM and other companies, but the failure was due to the lack of attention to customer and human orientation.\n\n\n\nIt was criticized that the failure was due to a failure to understand that this is a marketing technique that appeals to the human emotions of customers.\n\n\n\nCRM is a marketing method that increases customer satisfaction and loyalty.\n\nIt must be learned, understood, and implemented as part of the company's strategy.\n\nCRM is a strategy to improve business performance without being affected by the external environment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[ Requirements for achieving the true purpose]\n\n\n\nBecoming a company that is loved by customers will enable us to achieve long-term profits.\n\nThis is a very difficult challenge.\n\n\n\nHere we will discuss the CRM marketing elements that will help you achieve your goals.\n\nYour customer base consists of new and existing customers.\n\nDepartment stores also have external trade customers,

Problems with acquiring new customers\n\nDue to population decline, declining birthrate and aging population, and intensifying competition (entry of major retailers from other prefectures, etc.),\n\nAcquiring new customers is a challenge.\n\nYou may think that you are attracting new customers by distributing flyers, but most of the customers who come to your store because of the flyers are existing customers who only come during this sale.\n\nThis is an existing customer who is at the bottom or ninth in the decile analysis (top 10 divisions based on purchase amount).\n\nCLV will increase if the number of new customers increases, but the reality is that this is quite difficult.\n\nEven if you attract customers at extremely low prices, they will leave unless you continue to offer the lowest prices.\n\nWe live in an age where we cannot expect much increase in CLV from new customers.\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Problems with existing customers\n\nExisting customers are divided into the following categories:\n\nThey can be divided into super-valued customers, valued customers, and regular customers.\n\n\"Decile analysis\" is a customer identification method commonly used in supermarkets.\n\nDecile 1 customers are very valuable customers, 2nd and 3rd are best value customers, 4th to 6th deciles are general customers, and 7th deciles and below are reward-oriented customers.\n\n\n\nUsing RFM cell analysis information, AA customers can be classified as very valuable customers, AB customers as valued customers, and AC customers as average customers.\n\n\n\nCRM is a marketing method that develops regular customers into loyal customers and loyal customers into super loyal customers.\n\n\n\n\n\n3. The problem of customer defection\n\nMany regular customers tend to leave.\n\nThe number of customers who leave varies depending on the store and sales area.\n\nMany customers are leaving, with a defection rate of 10% to 30%.\n\nThis churn rate reduces CLV.\n\nOur loyal customers have almost zero churn rate. They keep buying.\n\nThese customers make a significant contribution to the CLV figures.\n\nHere are two important numerical terms:\n\nThis is a number that has a significant impact on the CLV value.\n\n\n\nOne is retention rate\n\nThe other is the churn rate.\n\n\n\nIf there are 1,000 existing customers, and 950 customers will be retained next year, and 50 customers will defect,\n\nOur existing customer retention rate is 95% and our churn rate is 5%.\n\n\n\nFurthermore, the retention rate the following year was 95%.\n\nOf the 950 existing customers, 95%, or 902 people, remain existing customers this year.\n\n48 people defect.\n\n\n\nThis will result in a decline in existing customers.\n\nAs a result, CLV falls.\n\n\n\nIf the churn rate is 20% or 30%, the CLV will be small and will suffer.\n\nThe average defection rate for supermarkets is around 30%.\n\nThe loss of existing customers must be compensated for by acquiring new customers.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is your current customer churn rate (or, conversely, retention rate)?\n\nDo you understand? A 30% increase is a huge blow to long-term profit growth.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are five types of defection rate patterns:\n\n\n\nLong-term customer pattern First year defection rate 5% Next year defection rate 5%\n\nMedium-life customer pattern: First-year defection rate: 25%; second-year defection rate: 10%\n\nFreaky customer pattern First year defection rate 50% Next year defection rate 10%\n\nShort-life customer pattern First year defection rate 50% Next year defection rate 50%\n\nInstantaneous customer lifespan pattern First year churn rate 100%\n\n\n\n\n\nYour company must aim for a long-life customer pattern.\n\nTo do this, you must clearly identify all of your customers.\n\n\u3000\n\n[ Responding to customer issues]\n\n\n\n1. Response to new customer acquisition\n\nIn an era of declining population, a declining birthrate and aging population, and intensifying competition, it is extremely difficult to deal with new customers.\n\nDue to the declining population, local department stores and supermarkets are facing very difficult times.\n\nThere are four possible ways to respond.\n\n\n\nOne is selling at reduced prices, attracting customers with extremely low prices.\n\nLowering prices reduces sales to existing customers, which lowers CLV.\n\nThere is a trade-off between low-price strategies and CLV, so it is not a strategy that should be pursued.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 3915, "end_char_idx": 8712, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "78b814e6-42c7-45cf-bed2-efd9cc55ad68": {"__data__": {"id_": "78b814e6-42c7-45cf-bed2-efd9cc55ad68", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"categories": ["Customer Value Analysis", "Loyalty & Retention", "Performance Measurement"], "keywords": ["Customer Lifetime Value", "Churn Rate", "Retention Rate", "Customer Investment Management", "ROI"]}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "5c848609-78c0-403f-8352-e5bcab154c1f", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_name": "\uff2a\uff23\uff21\uff29\uff12\uff10\uff14CRM_eng.docx", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Admin\\Desktop\\Advanced-RAG\\Oh No\\data\\\uff2a\uff23\uff21\uff29\uff12\uff10\uff14CRM_eng.docx", "file_type": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document", "file_size": 83295, "creation_date": "2025-08-15", "last_modified_date": "2025-08-15"}, "hash": "418d2936092c928f66853adbdd6c1bb79a870eac7bd8edad366706e8ff7439d3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "c0182794-8fc1-4681-8744-34aa61dcca64", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_name": "\uff2a\uff23\uff21\uff29\uff12\uff10\uff14CRM_eng.docx", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Admin\\Desktop\\Advanced-RAG\\Oh No\\data\\\uff2a\uff23\uff21\uff29\uff12\uff10\uff14CRM_eng.docx", "file_type": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document", "file_size": 83295, "creation_date": "2025-08-15", "last_modified_date": "2025-08-15"}, "hash": "19e768f603ffd88fc12804a492eb4e1a142779e9efdd15dbd06b489e93677c7e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "4": {"node_id": "a9936e80-7ce9-42d6-bdc1-e4c439c91ee6", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_name": "\uff2a\uff23\uff21\uff29\uff12\uff10\uff14CRM_eng.docx", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Admin\\Desktop\\Advanced-RAG\\Oh No\\data\\\uff2a\uff23\uff21\uff29\uff12\uff10\uff14CRM_eng.docx", "file_type": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document", "file_size": 83295, "creation_date": "2025-08-15", "last_modified_date": "2025-08-15"}, "hash": "84bf95b263c32447b6d1222754f08399eaf9adff9385de103eb66231569e99c4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "One is selling at reduced prices, attracting customers with extremely low prices.\n\nLowering prices reduces sales to existing customers, which lowers CLV.\n\nThere is a trade-off between low-price strategies and CLV, so it is not a strategy that should be pursued.\n\n\n\nThe second is to stock products that other companies don't have. Stocking health-conscious and vegan products (completely plant-based products) is one way to attract customers from far away. It's about stocking products that are only available there.\n\nUnder the guidance of a supermarket, we displayed products such as line-caught bonito from Kochi, bran bread from Nagoya, ancient rice cakes from Takamatsu, and dried hijiki seaweed from Uwajima. What surprised us was that two new customers came to the store from 30 kilometers away, and these customers came almost once a week.\n\n\n\nThe third is to get word of mouth from existing customers, very loyal customers, and loyal customers.\n\nTo do this, you need to plan the products, sales methods, and weekday events that will generate word of mouth for your company.\n\n\n\nThe fourth is to utilize social networking sites (SNS) to advertise the products your company handles and attract customers.\n\nDaimaru has organized a dedicated social media department, and the editors are interviewing customers at the Tokyo store. If you keep an eye on TikTok, you can see posts about events like the Hakata Daimaru 75th anniversary event and the Sapporo Daimaru event. However, since social media is advertising, it's unclear whether it's attracting new customers.\n\nIt might be better than doing nothing. I'm thinking of experimenting with using Instagram etc.\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Dealing with existing customers\n\nThere is no distribution industry or retail store that does not have defecting customers.\n\nThis year, there were zero defections. And those same customers will also have zero defections next year. This might be possible in a monopoly market with no other stores, but there is no such business area.\n\nIn a certain supermarket, the defection rate is less than 10% and the sales amount is in the top 30% of the decibel analysis.\n\nI was surprised to see a figure of over 90%.\n\nWhen I asked, I found out that this store was located on top of a small mountain, with no other stores nearby.\n\nThese rare cases are a different story; typically, around 30% to 40% of users leave.\n\nIn other words, the current retention rate seems to be between 60% and 70%.\n\n\n\nNow, you can easily answer the question of what to do to increase CLV in this situation.\n\nYes, that's right.\n\nIt's about reducing your churn rate. If you can improve your churn rate by 10%, your average customer lifetime will increase. It's like a healthy lifespan.\n\n\n\nThe following figures were published in the \"Loyalty Guide\" published by a London-based consulting firm:\n\n\n\nIf the annual retention rate is 50%, the average customer lifetime is 2 years\n\nIf the annual retention rate is 70%, the average customer lifetime is 3.3 years\n\nIf the annual retention rate is 80%, the average customer lifetime is 5 years\n\nIf the annual retention rate is 90%, the average customer lifetime is 10 years.\n\n\n\nIf the customer churn rate is 10% and the retention rate is 90%, this means that existing customers will continue to buy for an average of 10 years. Although the CLV figure is not shown, it will continue to rise.\n\nThe purpose of implementing CRM is to achieve long-term profit growth.\n\nTo maintain a high CLV, it is important to maintain a high customer retention rate and reduce customer churn as much as possible.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is another factor that contributes to increasing CLV.\n\nThis is explained in terms of cross-selling and up-selling.\n\n\n\nCross-selling is related purchasing.\n\nUpselling is getting a customer to buy a higher-grade product.\n\n\n\nIf a customer buys two items at a time, cross-selling means getting them to buy one more item, which increases CLV.\n\nIf the product is the same, you want customers to buy a higher-grade product. This increases CLV.\n\n\n\nIf this can be achieved, the average purchase price per customer will increase.\n\nThis means that CLV will increase.\n\n[How to allocate promotional investments] Who should you invest in to get the CLV effect?\n\n\n\nAllocating the promotional budget.

Annual budget planning. Budget allocation is the most important, most difficult to adjust, and most emotional issue.\n\nThe company's traditional budget allocation philosophy remains deeply rooted, making it extremely difficult to allocate budget to implement new strategies.\n\n\n\nThe budget allocation mentioned here is the allocation of the promotional budget.\n\nAdvertising expenses, seasonal event promotion expenses, and monthly flyer expenses are all promotional expenses.\n\nIn this budget planning, aren't you currently requesting a 5% increase on the previous year's budget?\n\nFor example, if 50 million yen is approved, would you use it as an expense within the budget for the fiscal year?\n\nThis is incorrect.\n\n\n\nA promotional budget is not an expense, but an investment that will generate profits.\n\nawareness throughout the company that promotional expenses are not expenses, but rather an \"investment.\" We must stop taking the attitude that anything is possible as long as it is within the budget.\n\nAs I will explain later, as long as it is an investment, how much profit will there be compared to the investment in sales promotion expenses?\n\nThe numerical profit margin calculated by dividing the profit amount by the promotion investment amount. Return on investment (ROI ) On Investment ) value must be indicated in the promotional application.\n\nWe consider the allocation of the promotional budget for promoting CRM implementation as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1. Allocating budget to acquiring new customers\n\n\n\nHe said that currently, acquiring new customers is a challenge.\n\nInvestment in acquiring new customers will be difficult to justify.\n\nYou think that flyer advertising will help you acquire new customers, but it is not effective at all. You need to think of a different way.\n\n\n\nOn page 6, we outlined four ideas for acquiring new customers.\n\nDecide which of these four you will implement, or whether to do all four, and create a budget allocation for the investments you will make. You will also predict the ROI figure.\n\n\n\nBudget allocation for relationship-strengthening promotional investments and special offers to retain customers\n\n\n\nThere is a lot of value in investing in existing customers. We set goals such as increasing customer retention rates by 10% and invest accordingly. However, not all existing customers are worth investing in.\n\nFrom the RFM cell information, the AA group of highly valued customers and the AB group of highly valued customers have the highest investment value. The investment value of the AC group of general customers (the group with the largest number of customers in the entire group) is very small.\n\n\n\nWhen it comes to investing, our experience shows that thank you letters are a worthwhile investment for department stores. For supermarkets, our recommended campaign of \"Get a discount sticker when you stick it on\" is highly popular with customers and highly worthwhile for existing customers who have a redistricting of 3 or more (based on a decile analysis).\n\n\n\nThere is one more thing I would like you to do with an emphasis on existing customers.\n\na word-of-mouth promotion .\n\nThe idea is to sell \"products that will spread word of mouth\" to the customers in the AA and AB groups of top value customers, and to plan \"sales promotions that will spread word of mouth.\" It doesn't require much investment. It all depends on your ideas.\n\nIf you don't provide something that will garner word of mouth, you won't get word of mouth. Word of mouth is the most effective form of free advertising, so please discuss your ideas with everyone. Word of mouth is an excellent promotional method for acquiring new customers who are difficult to attract.\n\nI've heard that in Europe and the US, there are specialized departments that promote word-of-mouth.

If it's been a year, the customer is completely defected and there's no chance of them coming back.\n\nIf we run a comeback campaign for RFM Cell's very best customers, the BA group, who are showing signs of defecting, and for best customers, the BB group, who are showing signs of defecting, nearly half of them tend to return (comeback experience).\n\nIf you're a supermarket, you might be able to attract customers who have been shopping with you for more than 30 days but not yet 50 days by offering them discount stickers. If it's been more than 60 days (without buying groceries at your store), they've probably moved or started shopping at another store. Investing in these customers is a waste.\n\n\n\nFrom a CLV perspective, customer churn lowers CLV. Therefore, you should take measures to prevent churn as soon as there are signs of churn.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs mentioned above, promotional expenses, advertising expenses, event expenses, etc. should not be considered as expenses but as customer investments, and you should consider who to invest in to effectively generate profits and then consider how to allocate your promotional investments.\n\n\n\nIt's the same as investing in stocks.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs I have said many times before, promotional expenses are not an expense. They are an investment.\n\nSince it is an investment, it is natural business practice to check the numbers to see how much profit you have made from your investment.\n\n\n\nIt is completely unclear how much profit the newspaper advertisements and flyers brought in.\n\nI believe that we are no longer in an era where business is so easy that it would be possible to do something like this.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[ Product strategy to attract customers]\n\nLet's consider product strategies that affect marketing activities from a CRM perspective.\n\nThis is a marketing strategy that merchandisers (whose main job is to plan product lineups) and buyers (whose main job is to procure products based on product lineup plans) are currently completely unaware of.\n\nWe will explain what product strategy from CRM is.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 16647, "end_char_idx": 19143, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1baf829d-afe7-409a-839a-9a1dfdb1b3da": {"__data__": {"id_": "1baf829d-afe7-409a-839a-9a1dfdb1b3da", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"categories": ["Customer Value Analysis", "Loyalty & Retention", "Performance Measurement"], "keywords": ["Customer Lifetime Value", "Churn Rate", "Retention Rate", "Customer Investment Management", "ROI"]}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "5c848609-78c0-403f-8352-e5bcab154c1f", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_name": "\uff2a\uff23\uff21\uff29\uff12\uff10\uff14CRM_eng.docx", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Admin\\Desktop\\Advanced-RAG\\Oh No\\data\\\uff2a\uff23\uff21\uff29\uff12\uff10\uff14CRM_eng.docx", "file_type": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document", "file_size": 83295, "creation_date": "2025-08-15", "last_modified_date": "2025-08-15"}, "hash": "418d2936092c928f66853adbdd6c1bb79a870eac7bd8edad366706e8ff7439d3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "4": {"node_id": "d76af632-572c-4fbe-ae59-14a38f0ec4d5", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_name": "\uff2a\uff23\uff21\uff29\uff12\uff10\uff14CRM_eng.docx", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Admin\\Desktop\\Advanced-RAG\\Oh No\\data\\\uff2a\uff23\uff21\uff29\uff12\uff10\uff14CRM_eng.docx", "file_type": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document", "file_size": 83295, "creation_date": "2025-08-15", "last_modified_date": "2025-08-15"}, "hash": "90925cbf88b705f5b274d93a181e22d33a3d48d639f417bd50ad7e96672ff637", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "[ Product strategy to attract customers]\n\nLet's consider product strategies that affect marketing activities from a CRM perspective.\n\nThis is a marketing strategy that merchandisers (whose main job is to plan product lineups) and buyers (whose main job is to procure products based on product lineup plans) are currently completely unaware of.\n\nWe will explain what product strategy from CRM is.\n\n\n\n\n\n1. Product strategy aimed at acquiring new customers\n\nI don't think it really qualifies as a strategy, but it's such an important consideration that I've decided to call it a strategy.\n\nProduct strategies to attract new customers. We negotiate products that will spread word of mouth and attract customers from far away, and then display them in each store and sales floor.\n\nIn supermarkets, some good products include Kochi's line-caught bonito tataki (conveniently stored in the refrigerator as it is a frozen food) and Osawa Japan's germinated brown rice cream. Osawa Japan is a company that develops products for vegetarians. They have many products that are beneficial to the health of consumers. Set up a vegetarian section.\n\nDepartment stores will set up vegan product shops, selling shoes, bags, belts, coats, and other clothing items that are not made from materials that involve animal cruelty. This is an appeal to animal ethics.\n\nWe will introduce products that cannot be purchased at other stores and products that can only be purchased here.\n\n\n\n2. Product strategies to increase customer retention\n\nIn a supermarket, each department has a product that has a high repeat purchase rate. This product can be positioned as a star product, and promotional investments can be made to let customers who have not yet purchased it know about it.\n\nIn department stores, branded products such as Hermes are purchased repeatedly. By frequently contacting the RFM cell of frequently purchasing branded products in the department store, the AA group of highly valued customers, and the AB group of highly valued customers, we can deepen our relationships. We develop general customers into valued customers, and valued customers into highly valued customers. These efforts will increase CLV.\n\n\n\n3. Cross-selling and upselling product strategies\n\nBooks by the same author and music by the same composer are cross-sold products. Plastic train models that you can enjoy by expanding are also cross-sold products.\n\nWe will pursue cross-selling (related purchases) and check the current situation, such as creating a sales floor and display location that encourages sales of related products, and consider ways to increase cross-selling sales.\n\nIf you can cross-sell and up-sell (guide customers to purchase better products), the average purchase price of existing customers will increase, leading to an increase in CLV.\n\n4. Product display strategies that spread word of mouth\n\nOn page 6, I mentioned four ideas for acquiring new customers, one of which is word of mouth.\n\nThe term \"oshikatsu\" (supporting one's favorite product) is currently popular, and it involves considering, introducing, and displaying favorite products.\n\nAs mentioned in the new customer product strategy, department stores will set up shops selling vegan ingredients. Vegan products are hard to find, so if your company sets up a shop, there is a high chance that customers will come from more than 50 kilometers away, which will help you acquire new customers.\n\nAlthough they may be purchasing online, if there is a sales area where they can see the actual product and shop in person, new customers will come to the store, increasing sales volume and sales amount. This will increase CLV.\n\nA vegan shop where you can buy products in person. Word of mouth will spread. Your store or sales area could spread at 100 kilometers per hour on social networking sites.\n\n\n\nIf supermarkets also stock vegan foods, it will become a hot topic among vegetarians and customers who follow a vegan lifestyle, and word of mouth will spread.\n\n\n\nWaitrose, a supermarket chain with 125 stores in London and a supplier to the Royal Family, has set up a vegan product section in every store. Tesco and Sainsbury's, the number one and number two supermarkets in the UK, also have vegan products on display. Carrefour in France also has vegan products on display.\n\nNearly 20% of the population is vegetarian, so it is becoming common to stock vegan products, a recent trend in the West.\n\n\n\n\n\n5. Product Strategy for Customer Comeback\n\nCompletely churn customers are not worth investing in.\n\nWhat should be considered is a sales floor strategy and product strategy to bring back customers who have been with us for more than 30 days in the case of supermarkets, or more than 90 days in the case of department stores, or customers who are prone to defection.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4805, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "27800075-3593-43f8-94fa-e24d916991ad": {"__data__": {"id_": "27800075-3593-43f8-94fa-e24d916991ad", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"categories": ["Customer Value Analysis", "Loyalty & Retention", "Performance Measurement"], "keywords": ["Customer Lifetime Value", "Churn Rate", "Retention Rate", "Customer Investment Management", "ROI"]}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "5c848609-78c0-403f-8352-e5bcab154c1f", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_name": "\uff2a\uff23\uff21\uff29\uff12\uff10\uff14CRM_eng.docx", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Admin\\Desktop\\Advanced-RAG\\Oh No\\data\\\uff2a\uff23\uff21\uff29\uff12\uff10\uff14CRM_eng.docx", "file_type": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document", "file_size": 83295, "creation_date": "2025-08-15", "last_modified_date": "2025-08-15"}, "hash": "418d2936092c928f66853adbdd6c1bb79a870eac7bd8edad366706e8ff7439d3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "1baf829d-afe7-409a-839a-9a1dfdb1b3da", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_name": "\uff2a\uff23\uff21\uff29\uff12\uff10\uff14CRM_eng.docx", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Admin\\Desktop\\Advanced-RAG\\Oh No\\data\\\uff2a\uff23\uff21\uff29\uff12\uff10\uff14CRM_eng.docx", "file_type": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document", "file_size": 83295, "creation_date": "2025-08-15", "last_modified_date": "2025-08-15"}, "hash": "301f09d5f2c5cc9ad13b3ed59c805a1e0ebc7079de9c4d4d1997f626ed5d0b57", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "4": {"node_id": "d76af632-572c-4fbe-ae59-14a38f0ec4d5", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_name": "\uff2a\uff23\uff21\uff29\uff12\uff10\uff14CRM_eng.docx", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Admin\\Desktop\\Advanced-RAG\\Oh No\\data\\\uff2a\uff23\uff21\uff29\uff12\uff10\uff14CRM_eng.docx", "file_type": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document", "file_size": 83295, "creation_date": "2025-08-15", "last_modified_date": "2025-08-15"}, "hash": "90925cbf88b705f5b274d93a181e22d33a3d48d639f417bd50ad7e96672ff637", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "5.

Paradigm means norms.\n\n\n\nConsider which types of customers you should invest in to get the highest return on investment (ROI), and invest in customers with the same mindset as investing in stocks. This is the CRM approach, and the way to determine whether you are achieving long-term profits is to check whether your CLV figures are trending high.\n\nCIM involves identifying customers and allocating budgets to each customer.\n\n\n\nThis promotional investment strategy is called Customer Investment Management. Its abbreviation is CIM. It stands for Customer Investment Management.\n\n\n\nCustomer marketing fund investment management, a concept of measuring the effectiveness of customer marketing fund investment.\n\n\n\nFor each promotion or event you run, this is a system that evaluates which promotions were profitable and which were in the red (loss) in relation to the investment of funds.\n\n\n\n\n\nCIM is a scientific method of customer strategy and a tactic that delivers results.\n\nCIM is a theory that allows optimal allocation of customer budgets.\n\nCIM is a management methodology that produces investment results that bring benefits to the client's budget rather than costs.\n\n\n\nCustomer investment management requires three decision-making metrics:\n\nThere are three important decisions to make:\n\n\n\nWhat should the customer investment budget level be?\n\nHow much of the customer investment budget should be allocated?\n\nMeasuring customer investment productivity and results with ROI\n\n\n\nROI ( Return On Investment ).\n\n\n\nThe passing mark is an ROI of 35%.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[CRM CLV CIM RFM important relationships]\n\n\n\nCRM is a marketing technique that increases long-term profits and increases profits as the years of operation progress.\n\n\n\nCLV is a figure that evaluates whether profits are expanding each year.\n\nCLV is the lifetime value per customer.\n\nIf CLV is increasing, it can be said that earning power is increasing year by year.\n\n\n\nFactors that increase CLV include acquiring new customers, maintaining existing customers, and preventing customer defection.\n\nThere are four elements to increasing the average purchase price per customer.\n\n\n\nCIM Customer Investment Management is the investment in acquiring new customers, maintaining existing customer retention rates, and increasing the average purchase price per customer.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo maintain a high ROI on customer investments,\n\nYou need to find out who you can invest in to get the highest return.\n\n\n\n\n\nRFM cell code analysis is the information that helps you determine who to invest in to get effective results.\n\nJust like with stock investment, information on which stocks to invest in and information from all angles is widely available.\n\n\n\nHowever, there is no widespread information on who to invest in to increase profits.\n\n\n\nRFM is a concept that is spreading worldwide.\n\nHowever, after using the US model (package), we felt that this was insufficient, and so far the RFM cell code information we developed has not been seen anywhere in the world.\n\n\n\nRFM cell information is extremely effective in identifying effective customers, such as those who are extremely valuable, those who are valued, those who are likely to defect, and those who have completely defected.\n\n\n\nBy using RFM cell information to invest in customers, you can achieve a high ROI, which, in turn, can lead to high CLV and increased long-term profits.\n\n\n\n[Reference information]\n\n\n\nHow to calculate CLV: A simple example\n\n\n\nSpecialty store/bakery chain CLV\n\nHow is CLV calculated?

Picture\" Six Big Boxes\n\nMarketing is How to proceed? About HOW\u3000\n\nMarketing System It consists of six boxes\n\n\n\nAuthor Krusti L. Nordheim.\n\nHe attended various marketing courses, read Kotler's \"Principles of Marketing,\" and studied various marketing books, but the theories were all scattered, and he was completely unable to understand what marketing was. There was no system for marketing. Although there were theoretical books on the steps to implementing marketing, there were no books that could serve as practical references.\n\n\n\nNordheim wrote at the beginning of this book that his research led him to the six big pictures he will now describe.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe six boxes are as shown in the figure.\n\nFirst, business goals: this year's sales target, profit target, operating profit margin\n\nSecond, marketing goals: number of new customers acquired, retention rate of existing customers, lifetime value per customer (=CLV)\n\nThird, source of volume: capturing market share\n\nFourth: STP; segmentation, targeting target customers, customer appeal positioning. Three initial letters of STP.\n\n5. Execution: Manufacturing and selling food, clothing, and shelter products, purchasing and selling food, clothing, and shelter products, and providing leisure and other services\n\n6. Evaluation: Did you achieve your goal of acquiring new customers? Did you achieve a 100% customer retention rate?\n\nHas the lifetime value per customer increased?\n\nFor all customer promotions implemented, was the return on investment (ROI) for the promotional investment amount 35% or more (said to be the pass mark)?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne is a box called Business Goals\n\n\n\nIdentify our areas of expertise, the most profitable product lineups, and categories. For example, what products are customers happy to buy? Which departments are our best buyers in charge of?\n\nDecide on your sales strategy. Will you appeal to low prices? EDLP? Or a wide range of value-added products?\n\nMake the most possible sales your business goal.\n\nMarketing is demand creation = customer creation. In retail store sales (real stores)\n\nDemand = Number of customers x CLV (lifetime value per customer) x Number of stores\n\nFor non-store sales (online sales)\n\nDemand = Number of small customers x CLV (lifetime value per customer)\n\n\n\nLifetime value per customer, not just the purchase amount per customer.\n\nOperating profit is the amount obtained by subtracting total sales expenses (cost of goods + promotional expenses) from the sales amount for the year.\n\nThis is called Net Profit Value (NPV). NPV divided by the number of customers\n\nThe number is the lifetime value per customer, or CLV.\n\nStore sales case: Sales = Number of customers x CLV x Number of stores\n\n1 million yen = 100 people x 10,000 yen x 1 store\n\n1 million yen = 200 people x 10,000 yen x 1 store\n\n1 million yen = 100 people x 20,000 yen x 1 store\n\n1 million yen = 100 people x 10,000 yen x 2 stores\n\n1 million yen = 200 people x 20,000 yen x 2 stores\n\n\n\nBusinesses must decide which strategy to use to achieve their goals: increasing customer numbers, increasing CLV per customer, or increasing the number of stores. Do they need to achieve all three? It's difficult. Focus on one.\n\nFirst, one.\n\n\n\nNumber of customers = Number of new customers acquired + Number of existing customers - Number of customers who have defected\n\n\n\nIf you want to increase the number of customers, should you acquire new customers or eliminate customer defections?\n\nIf you think it will be difficult to increase customer numbers, your marketing strategy should be to increase CLV by 5% from the previous year.\n\nIf you have the financial means, opening new stores or making acquisitions are growth strategies. So which one should you choose?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsecond box is called Marketing Objectives.\n\nMarketing goals. Let's think about what our marketing goals are. What kind of customers should we target? Young, middle-aged, mature (= middle-aged).\n\nWhat is the average number of customers per store?\n\nWhat is the goal for how many new customers to acquire each year? Keep the customer churn rate at 5%. If the churn rate is 5%, CLV will decrease if that number of new customers are not acquired. Marketing goals include the number of new customers to acquire and a 95% retention rate for existing customers.\n\nThe marketing goal is to increase CLV figures by 5% from the previous year.\n\n\n\nThe number of customers is: Number of customers = Number of new customers + Number of existing customers - Number of defecting customers\n\n\n\nAcquire 10% of the number of new customers from the previous year. \tThis is a difficult challenge in this day and age.\n\nAchieving a 100% retention rate for existing customers \t\tis also difficult. Usually, 15% of customers leave.\n\nA 5% increase in CLV per customer \tcompared to the previous year is feasible compared to the above two.\n\n\n\nCustomers are new and existing customers\n\nIt is said that it costs five times as much to sell to a new customer as it does to sell to an existing customer.\n\nA 5% improvement in customer churn rates among existing customers will increase profits by at least 25%.\n\n(\"Customer Loyalty Management\" Diamond Publishing)\n\nThe more customers continue to purchase from you, the more profit you can make from them.\n\nOn the other hand, if a customer stops buying after one purchase, the costs incurred to acquire them cannot be recovered.\n\nThe main theme of the marketing goal is\n\nExisting customer retention rate: It's a difficult task, but we aim for 100%.\n\nCustomer retention is the ultimate marketing goal.\n\n\n\nA talk by the CEO of Netscape Communications.\n\nWhen I asked a new employee, \"What is the purpose of the business?\", he answered, \"To make money.\"\n\n\"No, our goal is to acquire and retain customers,\" he instructed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe third box is called Volume Source.\n\n\n\nWhere does the sales come from?\n\nFrom selling products. From selling goods. From selling service goods.\n\nWell, that's true, but we also need to have a more strategic perspective.\n\nWhat are the high-volume categories?\n\nIf it's a department store, should it be foreign brands like Hermes, cosmetics, jewelry for the wealthy, duty-free goods for inbound tourists, or underground food?\n\nIt has further been subdivided into fashion items such as overseas brands, clothing such as bags, and cosmetics.\n\n\n\nIf it's a supermarket, do you buy meat, vegetables, fresh fish, or prepared foods?\n\nFurther granularity: meat steak or grilled meat, fresh bluefin tuna, prepared food or bento\n\n\n\nIf it's a service\n\nDomestic and international travel, theater, sports, live music, musicals?\n\n\n\nSales volume by category, percentage of total sales for each category,\n\nFurthermore, who are the target customers for creating volume? Are they young, middle-aged, or machucas (elderly)? What is the main trade area or region?\n\n\n\nWe will explore these issues in our marketing efforts.\n\nThis specific consideration moves to the fourth box, STP Strategy.\n\nThere are three small boxes in the fourth large box.\n\nOne is segmentation \tstrategy\n\nThe second is targeting strategy \t.\n\nThe third is positioning strategy \t.\n\nThe three initials stand for STP.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFour are STP boxes, three small boxes\n\nOne of them is segmentation\n\n\n\nWhy do we need to segment?\n\nThat's because thinking that all customers are the same, that an unspecified number of people are all customers, is not efficient and results in inefficient return on investment (POI).\n\nThis is because promotional campaigns that involve throwing things around often waste promotional funds. The aim is to concentrate promotional funds on customer segments with the greatest opportunities. This is marketing. The aim is to focus on customers and regions with the greatest opportunities. This is the way business and marketing should be.\n\n\n\nThe main segmentation patterns are by customer and region.\n\nCustomer segmentation includes age, generation, life stage, lifestyle, etc.\n\nAges include 20s, 30s, 40s, 50s, 60s, 70s, etc.\n\nIn terms of life stages, there are single, newlywed, first child, two-generation family, children leaving home and becoming a married couple again, mature (= elderly generation), etc.\n\nLifestyle segmentation: There is also lifestyle segmentation that assumes lifestyle habits based on purchased product data. Convenience store lover, meat lover, bento lover, vegetarian, bulk purchase lover, fruit lover, bulk purchase lover, etc.\n\n\n\n\n\nRegional Segmentation\n\nIn the Kanto region, Shibuya, Shinjuku, Minato, Chiyoda, Setagaya, Adachi, Itabashi, and Arakawa\n\nThe characteristics of customers who live along the Seibu Line, Toyoko Line, Tokyu Line, Kawagoe Line, etc. can be determined to some extent.\n\n\n\nIn Kansai\n\nAmagasaki, Nishinomiya, Ashiya, south of Namba and north of Umeda. There are differences in the shirts and suits worn.\n\nNara, Kyoto, Toyonaka, Ikeda, Takatsuki, Sakai, Matsubara.\n\nThere are also differences along the Hankyu lines (Kobe Line and Kyoto Line), Nankai lines, Kintetsu lines, and subway lines.\n\nWhich customer profile should be carefully selected for volume? Young, middle-aged, or mature elderly?\n\nWhich areas and residents along the railway line will be the source of volume?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4 STP boxes 3 small boxes\n\nNumber 2: Targeting\u3000\n\n\n\nDetermine where our opportunities lie in customer segmentation.\n\nAssessment of segment volume sources.\n\nAre they over 60? Or maybe in their 40s or 50s?\n\nAre you at the single stage, the first child birth stage, or perhaps even the mature stage (i.e. older generation)?\n\n\n\nIn which product categories do we have volume opportunities?\n\nDrill down to the finer details to determine opportunities.\n\n\n\nIn regional segmentation, Shibuya Ward, Minato Ward, Setagaya Ward,\n\nAs for railway lines, should we focus on the Tokyu line? Tokyu stores are located along the Tokyu line. In that case, we should consider areas around stations on the Seibu line that offer high opportunities as our main areas.\n\nIn the Kansai region, we are considering Nishinomiya, Toyonaka, H2O Izumiya Hankyu Kansai Supermarket, OK is also building a new store, can we beat OK EDLP? We will consider other segment opportunities.\n\n\n\nThere is a database that stores receipt data. If not, use the Jericho Cloud service.\n\n\n\na \"region/age matrix\" that displays the number of customers purchasing by region and age group and their composition ratio (ratio of customers by region and age group to the store total), as well as the purchase amount and its composition ratio (same as above).\n\n\n\nThis information is used to specify the product and service menu.\n\nEnter the main source of sales volume, such as meat, bento, or Japanese daily products.\n\nCustomer segment/regional segment. Set segments with a high number of customers and their composition ratio, as well as segments with a high purchase amount and their composition ratio as your main targets.\n\n\n\nRather than relying on intuition, you should refer to the results of customer demand over the past year or so, and specifically and objectively determine which demand opportunities to target. This is how marketing is implemented.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4 STP boxes 3 small boxes\n\nNo. 3: Positioning\u3000\n\n\n\nCompetitor companies sell similar products in similar shelf layouts and with similar sales floor layouts.\n\nWe segmented customers and regions and considered opportunities for each segment.\n\nThis is not enough. We are selling the same products in the same way as our competitors, and using the same sales promotion methods. We have segmented, targeted, and decided to target segments that offer the greatest opportunity for investment in sales promotion funds. This is not enough.\n\n\n\nThere is an easy-to-understand example.\n\nPositioning done by American Dial Soap.\n\n\"Skin-beautifying effect\" for women. \"Body odor prevention\" for men. But we don't just sell soap.\n\nCoca-Cola. \"A refreshing Coca-Cola!\" \"Coca-Cola to quench your thirst!\"\n\nPositioning is effective in stimulating customers' subconscious minds.\n\n\"Buy soap\" and \"Buy Coca-Cola\" are already ingrained in the brain in the subconscious mind. Soap, Coca-Cola. Customer needs are soap, Coca-Cola.\n\nIt is said that the conscious mind accounts for 5% and the subconscious mind accounts for 95%.\n\nPositioning stimulates 95% of the subconscious mind.\n\nIn the parcel delivery industry, FedEx has long ago implemented a service called \"delivery within three days from order.\"\n\nPositioning will be such as \"Delivery within 3 hours and 30 minutes of the afternoon of the next day after ordering.\"\n\nPositioning can be done through things like a free return guarantee, a 24-hour inquiry service, a dedicated toll-free number service, or a free lifetime warranty.\n\n\n\nOur sales floor development and product assortment positioning.\n\nConsider the positioning of each product sold.\n\nSelling point = Keywords = Cache copy = POP = Positioning\n\nPositioning creation. Other companies may soon imitate and follow suit.\n\nEven so, the original pioneering company will be questioned by the media and remembered by customers.\n\nThe first one to arrive wins.\n\n\n\nPositioning Setting Tips\n\nThink carefully about the benefits of the product, write them down in a notebook, and then make a decision.\n\nProducts are bundles of benefits\n\nBenefit = convenience. Hammer = benefit of hammering nails\n\nThe benefits of a car are: you can get to your destination quickly, you can drive with your girlfriend, it's convenient for shopping, and many more.\n\nWhat benefits does the product or item you are selling offer?\n\nMarketing is about how (channel), how much (price), and what kind of promotion a product or item will be sold - Kotler's 4Ps are not marketing.\n\nPositioning is about what message to send to stimulate the subconscious mind about the value (added value) of a product or item.\n\n\n\nCoca-Cola \"quenches thirst.\" Soap for women \"beautiful skin\" and men \"prevents body odor.\"\n\nViagra \"Sexual Performance\" \"Couples Experience Pleasure\".\n\nRed sports car: \"Attracts interest from women who are out of reach\" and \"Secures a lover\"\n\n\n\nBenefits can be divided into functional benefits and emotional benefits.\n\nThe functional benefits of a car are transporting people and goods. Safety, operability, and fuel efficiency are also functional benefits.\n\nThe emotional benefit is the sense of belonging that comes from wanting to ride in the same car as other people.\n\nToyota's Lexus, Nissan's Bluebird, EV company \"Tesla,\" etc. are all things I aspire to.\n\nWe propose a close link between functional benefits and emotional benefits.\n\n\n\nSupermarkets and drugstores.\n\n\"A slim and toned body\" is a vegetarian diet = vegetables, fruits, and almond milk\n\n\"Vegetarianism is good for preventing illness\" = Tomatoes, spinach and soy milk\n\n\"Anti-aging\" = Meatless Monday = Paul McCartney\n\n(Meatless Mondays, a movement spreading around the world)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFive big boxes called \"Do\" and four small boxes inside them.\n\nProduct service, price, channel, and promotion\n\n\n\nThe execution here refers to the execution of marketing goals, including the segmentation, targeting, and positioning that have been set to achieve the marketing goals.\n\n\n\nProduct (= goods), service product box\n\nDeciding what products to purchase and how to arrange the product lineup in order to acquire new customers, retain existing customers, and prevent defections.\n\nWe purchase and stock our products with an eye to what products will be most suitable for the target age group or life stage.\n\nThe same idea applies to service products.\n\nFor example, for mature people (those aged 65 and over),\n\nWe offer a selection of healthy products, and for the child-rearing stage, we offer a selection of easy-to-eat, timeless products.\n\nFor mature customers, we offer service products such as cruises around Japan and cruises in the Aegean Sea.\n\nIn addition, to attract new customers, we introduce and stock products that cannot be purchased at other stores.\n\nTo retain existing customers, measures such as using receipt data to position products with \"high purchase rates and high repeat rates\" on POP displays will be implemented to prevent customer defections.\n\n\n\nPrice: Consideration and implementation of sales price\n\nNewly introduced products will be sold at special prices to attract new customers.\n\nOne method of setting prices is to set 5% of the products in the assortment at the same price as cost, 10% at 10% above cost, 15% at 20% above cost, 15% at 30% above cost, and the remaining 50% at 35% above cost, etc. This is the kind of pricing policy we will implement.\n\nAnother thing to consider when setting prices is by item (natto, tofu, yogurt, etc.).\n\nPrices are determined and implemented using Priceline's three-tier pricing principle: \"lower price, middle price, upper price.\"\n\n\n\nRunning a channel\n\nThis will be implemented through a retail sales channel that only sells in real stores (= analog stores).\n\nThis will be implemented through a channel that sells only online (=digital) sales.\n\nIt will be sold through a dual channel (omnibus) of physical stores and online sales.\n\nThere are three main channels.\n\nDecide which of the three channels is right for your company and implement it.\n\nThe marketing objectives include acquiring new customers, retaining existing customers, and preventing customer churn. The evaluation of these objectives is explained in Box 6.\n\nThe standard is to evaluate at the end of the year, but if the fiscal year ends, progress observation is not possible. I would like to observe progress over the course of the period. There is a way to do this.\n\nRegardless of the fiscal year, it is the previous year and the current year. For example, if it is the end of September this year, specify the period from October of last year to September of this year.\n\n\"Purchase Amount by Amount Rank\" information. This information allows you to understand the number of new customers acquired and the number of customers who have defected. It is also possible to understand the number of new customers acquired and the number of customers who have defected in the nine months from the beginning of the year to the current month (end of September). Use this information to monitor progress.\n\n\n\nPromotion Execution\n\nThe newly introduced product is Decile 1, Decile 2, and Decile 3 for 30% of customers based on the \"Decile Analysis\" information.\n\nNew product introduction proposals will be implemented through direct mail promotions.\n\n, promotions are carried out by sending direct mail about \"new products\" to customers in the 1st to 3rd deciles of each sales floor (= shop) .\n\n\n\n\"RFM Cell\" information is effective for promotions to prevent defection .\n\nThe number of customers displayed in RFM cell and BB cell are customers who have not yet completely defected but are showing signs of defecting.\n\nIf we offer a product to this number of customers, there is a possibility that more than 50% of them will return.\n\nIf left unattended, they will completely abandon you and you will lose your existing customers.\n\n\n\nSocial events do not need to be promoted with special promotional funds.\n\nAn assortment of seasonal products, including fruits, some fresh fish such as sweetfish, etc.\n\nTest sales were conducted earlier than the previous year for customers in the Decile 1 to Decile 3 ranges.\n\nGet customers who are sensitive to seasonal products (=early adopters = early adopters) to visit your store before other companies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6. Evaluation of marketing activities A box called\n\n\n\nBoxes 1 to 6 are arranged in a row, flowing from upstream to downstream of a river.\n\nIn other words, the sixth box is organically connected.\n\nIt starts with business goals, followed by marketing goals, volume sources, STP, execution, and evaluation.\n\nThe process is goal, plan, execute, and evaluate.\n\nis the assessment of the results of planning and execution .\n\nDid you increase the number of new customers you acquired by 10% compared to the previous year?\n\nPreviously, we had 10% of our goal of 5,000 existing customers. Were we able to acquire 500 new customers?\n\nThe goal is to retain existing customers at 100%. Have we achieved 100% retention?\n\nIf it was only 90%, that would be a 10% decrease from 5,000 people.\n\nThis year, there were 4,500 purchasing customers.\n\nIf you were able to acquire 500 new customers, a 10% increase, you would make up for the 500 customers who defected, bringing your current customer count to 5,000. This means that 500 customers will have been replaced from the previous year. However, if you only gained 200 new customers, you would lose 300 customers this year. This would bring your current customer count to 4,200. This would mean a 16% customer attrition rate. CLV would fall by the amount of the decrease in customer count.\n\n\n\nSo far, we have looked at data for one year's total for each store. This is still insufficient. What caused the decrease in customers? We need more in-depth data (i.e., customer analysis information by amount rank) to determine whether new customer acquisition was on target.\n\nSupermarkets, drug stores, and home centers are sorted by department, class, and item. Department stores include Louis Vuitton, Hermes, shoe departments, bag departments, Kana Shojuan, Bunmeido, and Juchheim.\n\n\n\nBy department, and then by subdivision of the department (designating the department, then the subdivision).\n\nIn department stores, there are shoe sections, bag sections, sections by shop, such as Kana Shojuan, Bunmeido, and Hermes.\n\n\n\nBy specifying the period from January to December last year and this year, or from January to June or the first half or second half of July to December, the number of new customers acquired, the number of customers who have defected, and the total number of customers who have made purchases this year (= number of existing customers) can be displayed for each sales area in just three minutes.\n\n\n\nIf the number of new customers acquired is low, such as zero customer defections, then the sales floor or shop has very high customer satisfaction.\n\nIf the opposite were true, it could be evaluated as a sales area where customers are dissatisfied.\n\n\n\nOnce a year, the number of new customers acquired, the number of defected customers, and customers who have spent over 1 million yen on all sales floors are displayed on a single screen, along with customer rankings by purchase amount.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is also a way to target people based on their life stage.\n\nOne of the segmentations: life stage\n\n\n\nLife Stage Segmentation Part 1\n\nLife, from the cradle to the grave. As we grow, we experience different stages.\n\nBaby stage. Toddler stage, elementary school, junior high school, high school, and university learning stages.\n\nThe single stage, the life stage of a newly married couple (newlyweds), the stage of raising children, the stage of family growth with the birth of a second child, the stage of children moving out, and the stage of old age. Everyone experiences the life cycle of life.\n\nDepending on the stage you are in, your emotions, desires, needs, and wants will be different.\n\nIn his book \"Career Couples,\" which describes the roles of men and women in the new era, he describes life stages as follows:\n\nThe couple stage (starting at marriage and up to the birth of the first child), the expansion stage (from the birth of the first child to the birth of the second child), the peak stage (when there are two or more preschool-aged children), the full house stage (until the first child leaves home), the contraction stage (ending when the last child moves out), and the empty family stage (when all the children have left).\n\n\n\n\n\nLife Stage Segmentation Part 2\n\nSegmentation by generation, also known as generational marketing.\n\nA marketing method that treats generations as a single group.\n\nBaby Boomers, second generation baby boomers, Generation Z, Millennials, etc.\n\nBaby boomer Taichi Sakaiya published a book titled \"The Baby Boomer Generation,\" which became a huge bestseller.\n\n\n\nGeneration Z refers to those born between the late 1990s and early 2010s. As of 2025, they are between the ages of 13 and 29.\n\nThey are also known as digital natives, who grew up in an environment where the internet and smartphones were widespread from an early age, and social natives who are adept at using social media.\n\nA generation that flocks to the city's downtown areas .\n\n\n\nMillennials are people born between the 1980s and mid-1990s, experienced the spread of digital technology, and are adept at using social media. As of 2025, they will be between 35 and 45 years old. They are the generation that primarily raises children. Many women are unmarried, and many are working. They are the main consumers. Known as the \"king of singers, \" Lady Gaga (born March 28, 1986) is an American singer-songwriter, music producer, actress, businesswoman, and philanthropist, and is said to be a representative of the millennial generation.\n\n\n\nLife Stage Segmentation Part 3\n\nAll developed countries are simultaneously entering an aging society, and are said to be living in an aging society with a declining birthrate.\n\nJapan is at the forefront, followed by China, South Korea, North Korea, etc. Countries with large immigrant populations, Asia, Africa, and India are developing countries. Japan's major retailers are competing to enter Asian countries and India in search of growth.\n\n\n\nThe largest population in Japan is 36.96 million people aged 65 or over. The values of this elderly generation are said to be as follows:\n\nYoung people simply focused on price when making their purchases, but older people value value over price.\n\nBased on past purchase experiences, they feel dissatisfied or lacking in bargain items. They place importance on value.\n\nDuring your working life, you have three places: work, family, and friends. When you retire, you lose your workplace. You make up for it with the two remaining circles. You tend to prefer social circles.\n\nThey like independence. They stick to their own ideas. They make their own decisions. They are not easily influenced by the opinions of others. They have a desire to live independently, both mentally and physically, without relying on others.\n\n\n\nIt's a common misconception that retirement causes the brain of an older person to hibernate until death.\n\nThis is far from the truth. Mature people have time for themselves. They can expand their horizons in new ways, big and small. They have renewed energy and an eye for expanding their knowledge. They have a desire to learn and expand their horizons.\n\n\n\nWith age comes a wealth of wisdom and experience, and I feel happy when people ask me to share my hard-earned experience and knowledge.\n\nThey would be pleased if they were given the opportunity to show respect and act as mentors and advisors. The distribution industry needs to develop marketing that targets more middle-aged people (i.e., mature people). There is little knowledge about the psychology and strengths of the elderly.\n\n\n\nLife Stage Segmentation Part 4\n\nIntergenerational values are called cohorts.\n\nA cohort is a group of people who grew up in the same era and were influenced by the same external events that shaped their lives as they grew older.\n\nThe US middle-aged cohort is defined as follows:\n\nA group born before the mid-1920s who grew up in the midst of the Great Depression.\n\nThis generation was born in the late 1920s and early 1930s and was less affected by the Great Depression during their youth, but was heavily affected by World War II.\n\nThe generation born during peacetime from the late 1930s to 1946 is known as the Silent Generation.\n\nThe youngest generation are baby boomers, born after 1946.\n\nThey were an unprecedented generation in American history who were influenced by hippie culture around the time of the Vietnam War (1950s).\n\nThe older generation, who lived through the Great Depression, sees debt as almost a crime.\n\n65 have no debt, including paid-off mortgages.\n\nBaby boomers, the youngest generation, rely on credit as a financial tool. They spend a lot on repayment (payment on credit), making them a valuable consumer for retailers like Walmart.\n\n\n\nLife Stage Conclusions;\n\nConsider the department you are in charge of and which stage you want to target.\n\nBuyers, what product are you currently purchasing? What stage is it for?\n\nSales representative: What stage is the product you just picked up aimed at?\n\nWhen selling something, you have to be conscious of your customers. Who you are selling to, who you want to buy,\n\nIf you purchase, display, and sell products without this in mind, you will not be able to attract many customers.\n\nBe strongly aware of segmentation, targeting, positioning, and STP.\n\n\n\nThere is also a way to target people based on their lifestyle .\n\nOne of the segmentations: Lifestyle\n\n\n\nIn order to satisfy customer needs, marketing that focuses on the customer's lifestyle is a marketing method that allows you to get closer to customers than just their life stage.\n\nconsumers from a psychological perspective.\n\nSociologist D.G. Moore defines lifestyle as \"a patterned way of living.\" Psychologist G.W. Allport defines it as \"a view of life and values that are gradually formed in the course of life .\" Customers are human beings with emotions. Different people feel differently.\n\n\n\nThe lifestyles of the pre-war and post-war generations\n\nFrugality is the motto, hard work and savings. Sacrificing today for tomorrow's happiness. Emphasizing human bonds. Living peacefully with family and the community. A world of \"we.\" Currently, a world of \"I am me.\" Putting others on the back burner. It's even worse than that. Indifferent to others. It's okay as long as you're having fun. Not interested in the person living next door. Don't say hello.\n\nAt home, locked in my room, staring at my smartphone. While walking down the street, riding my bike. Is there urgent news? A friend sitting next to me. We're talking on our smartphones. It's not really a discussion. The family is falling apart. The daughter and son are mentally independent. A lifestyle where money is the purpose of life. The elderly are seen as a social scourge. The internet society is creating complex lifestyles. Nearly 100% of food purchases are made at convenience stores.\n\nA young person died from some reason. A certain monk said, \"It doesn't decay easily.\" That's right, there are a lot of preservatives in the body. A slice of bread from a convenience store doesn't grow blue mold even after a week.\n\n\n\nWe will provide a detailed explanation of lifestyle segmentation and targeting.\n\nThe lifestyle segment has the advantage of being able to extract customers who more closely match their needs.\n\nIn department stores, the divisions by brand and sales floor are similar to lifestyles. The sales floors are divided into categories based on what people want to buy. Ferragamo, Chanel, Christian Dior, Louis Vuitton, Coach, Clinic, Ralph Lauren, Kenzo, Sanrio, Miki House, Kana Shojuan, Bunmeido, Minamoto Kitchoan, Juchheim, Godiva, Morozoff, etc. The sales floor itself reflects customer needs.\n\n\n\nHome centers stock products related to professional construction, kids' hobbies, gardening, outdoor leisure, pet life, DIY, cycling, interior design, farming, kitchens, bathrooms and toilets, home appliances, organization, and more.\n\nCustomers who buy drills and saws are registered with the \"Construction Pro\" lifestyle.\n\nCustomers who buy things like flower seeds and lawnmowers are considered to have a \"gardening\" lifestyle.\n\n\n\nAt a drugstore, customers who buy energy drinks are considered \"energy drinkers , \" customers who buy anti-aging supplements are considered \"anti-aging\" lifestyle, and customers who buy diet-related products are considered \"diet\" lifestyle.\n\n\n\nAs for supermarkets, let us introduce the lifestyle initiatives undertaken by their headquarters in London, UK.\n\n\"Convenience Store,\" \"Cooking,\" \"Healthy,\" \"Big Box,\" \"Small Foods,\" \"Green\"\n\nIt defined around 30 lifestyles, including \" fruit,\" \"low price,\" \"private brand,\" \"value foods,\" \"traditional,\" \"latch box,\" \"ethnic,\" \"high price,\" \"meat,\" and \"vegetarian.\"\n\n\n\nis assigned 30 lifestyle codes such as \"This is meat,\" \"This product is a high-end accessory,\" or \"This product is a health food.\"\n\nThe receipt detail data will reveal the lifestyle code, and purchases with a high number of that code will correspond to the appropriate lifestyle.\n\n\n\nLifestyle Customer Identification, developed by Jericho Consulting, takes a different approach to identifying lifestyles.\n\nFor example, customers who buy more than 20 items from the prepared food section per month are classified as \"convenience type,\" while customers who buy Tomaru udon soup, miso, soy sauce, and olive oil are classified as \"kitchen type\" or \"cooking type.\"\n\nA lifestyle bar for registering such things is displayed on the screen.\n\n\n\nBy specifying a three-month period and clicking the \"Cooking\" bar, customers who have purchased over 100,000 yen worth of products such as Tomaru Udon soup and miso from the receipt data stored in the database will be classified as cooking lovers.\n\nThe number of customers is counted, and if there are 50, the bar displays 50. By displaying a list of 50 people, you can extract 50 customers as promotional targets.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStanford Research Institute (SRI) spent over 10 years\n\nAnalysis of purchasing data from thousands of Americans, categorization into nine lifestyle patterns\n\n\n\nResearch has begun to prove Maslow's \"Five-stage pyramid of needs.\"\n\nMaslow explained the five levels of human needs in \"The Complete Man,\" published in 1964. The book became a hot topic around the world. The five levels begin with \"physiological needs,\" then move on to \"safety needs,\" and then to the even higher level of \"social conformity needs.\" Next comes \"ego needs,\" which are the desire to be recognized by others, and at the top of the pyramid is the need for self-actualization.\n\nThe Stanford Research Institute is a spade diagram, as shown in Figure.\n\nFrom the bottom up, Survivor, Sustainer, and Belonger.\n\nFrom there it splits into left and right.\n\nLeft: Emulator, Achiever.\n\nRight side: I Am Me, Experiential, Socially Conscious.\n\nThe top is integrated self-actualization.\n\nA group struggling to survive is called a survivor (to survive), a sustainer (to hang on) , and a conservative, traditional Belonger.\n\nEmulators are young people who strive to get ahead. Achievers are\n\nA middle-aged man who has been promoted to department manager and executive.\n\nOn the right are I Am Me. Achievers' children. Experimentalists are people seeking social experience, and Social Conscious are people with a high level of social awareness.\n\nMaintaining the global environment, curbing climate change, sustainability, SDGs.\n\nThe arrows in the diagram. Lifestyles move left and right, and up and down and left and right with social changes and changes in the times.\n\nWhat is particularly noteworthy is that compared to 50 years ago, the number of achievers (those with high salaries) has become extremely small and has shrunk. I Am Me is centered around many Z households.\n\nIt can be expected that the population below Belonger has increased significantly.\n\nMost of the 36.96 million people aged 65 or older are in this group. \"I am me\" is extremely individualistic. As long as I'm happy, other people don't matter.\n\nThe year is 2025, a time of rising prices, and the population is growing.The company is dealing with low-income people who are ``I am me'' (people who do not consume much material goods) and below the ``Belonger'' level.\n\nWe are now in an environment where marketing and CRM are becoming increasingly important.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAiming to attract customers through brand building\n\nAcquire new customers, maintain existing customer retention rates, and increase CLV\n\nBrand Thinking Use\n\n\n\nIf you have a brand, you can set your positioning.\n\nA brand is more than a product. It's something that is created in the minds of customers.\n\nWhen customers see a brand logo, they know what it is.\n\nNo explanation needed. Everyone knows it.\n\nFor example, when a housewife buys juice, a story emerges: \"Kids love it. It's good for your health!\"\n\n\n\nA brand communicates technology, quality, functional characteristics, benefits, and empathy to customers.\n\nA brand is a customer's \"memory aid,\" \"quality information,\" and \"basis for differentiation.\"\n\nA brand is something that motivates customers to buy.\n\n\n\nMercedes-Benz is prestigious. Sony is a pioneer. Kellogg is a familiar brand.\n\nKleenex is disposable. Harry Potter is a story. Nike is a sport.\n\nStarbucks is postmodern. Rolex is luxury. Tiffany is joy.\n\nDavid Beckham is an idol. Harley Davidson is a man. Guinness is overtime.\n\nAmazon is internet shopping. Domino's Pizza is home delivery.\n\n\n\nBrand Law\n\nA brand is powerful when it's focused. Create a word in the mind of your customers.\n\nThe easiest way to destroy a brand is to put it on every product.\n\nUse colors that are opposite to your competitors. Brands are names. Ultimately, a brand is a name.\n\nWhen deciding on a brand name, consider things like: is it easy to pronounce? Does it have a musical sound? Can you write it down after hearing it once? Is it easy to read? Does it speak clearly? Is it concise? Is it unique? Is it interesting? Does it feel authentic?\n\n\n\nBranding is about \"how it makes the customer feel.\" The manager of Walt Disney Attractions said, \"What we sell is happiness.\"\n\n\n\nRevlon CEO Charles Revson said:\n\n\"We make cosmetics in our factories\" and \"we sell hope in our stores.\"\n\n\n\nSwatch made watches easy fashion.\n\nThe Central Market owner\n\n\"It's not about the selection, it's about the shopping experience.\"\n\nCoca-Cola has successfully revived its traditional flavor as \"Classic.\"\n\n\n\nSeven's brand \"Seven Premium\" and Aeon's brand \"Top Value\".\n\nThe meaning is uncertain.\n\nLarge companies can do it, but small and medium-sized companies can't. That's not true. Even small and medium-sized companies can do it.\n\nBrand the sales floor not through the products, but through the layout of the sales corners.\n\n\n\n\"Healthy,\" \"Slim and sharp,\" \"A small gift,\" \"A unique snack.\"\n\n\"Sorry it always sells out!\" \"Vegan food!\" \"Cute!\" \"Colorful\"\n\n\"Nut collection,\" \"Made in India,\" \"Ethnic.\"", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 38234, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9ad5f644-53ac-4f42-afff-f5e100ad323f": {"__data__": {"id_": "9ad5f644-53ac-4f42-afff-f5e100ad323f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_name": "\uff2a\uff23\uff21\uff29\uff13\uff10\uff12\uff2d\uff2b\u69cb\u9020_eng.docx", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Admin\\Desktop\\Advanced-RAG\\MergingCode\\data\\\uff2a\uff23\uff21\uff29\uff13\uff10\uff12\uff2d\uff2b\u69cb\u9020_eng.docx", "file_type": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document", "file_size": 197019, "creation_date": "2025-08-15", "last_modified_date": "2025-08-15"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "505b2418-d6c0-49f9-8883-249f5ea0f8e3", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_name": "\uff2a\uff23\uff21\uff29\uff13\uff10\uff12\uff2d\uff2b\u69cb\u9020_eng.docx", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Admin\\Desktop\\Advanced-RAG\\MergingCode\\data\\\uff2a\uff23\uff21\uff29\uff13\uff10\uff12\uff2d\uff2b\u69cb\u9020_eng.docx", "file_type": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document", "file_size": 197019, "creation_date": "2025-08-15", "last_modified_date": "2025-08-15"}, "hash": "884e110f65af94908bce267b6fe0496b51cb442c0543e5b3e59b58348c44f49b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "e36cd957-8168-4da0-95bd-9c192e19db0d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_name": "\uff2a\uff23\uff21\uff29\uff13\uff10\uff12\uff2d\uff2b\u69cb\u9020_eng.docx", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Admin\\Desktop\\Advanced-RAG\\MergingCode\\data\\\uff2a\uff23\uff21\uff29\uff13\uff10\uff12\uff2d\uff2b\u69cb\u9020_eng.docx", "file_type": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document", "file_size": 197019, "creation_date": "2025-08-15", "last_modified_date": "2025-08-15"}, "hash": "2a8855510ab2c3d07738e7ca9d2dafeca28e5d5ba95fe356c5bb1acc8dab4ea3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "5": [{"node_id": "39f5f718-a544-486f-b99e-7ae9deed5b11", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_name": "\uff2a\uff23\uff21\uff29\uff13\uff10\uff12\uff2d\uff2b\u69cb\u9020_eng.docx", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Admin\\Desktop\\Advanced-RAG\\MergingCode\\data\\\uff2a\uff23\uff21\uff29\uff13\uff10\uff12\uff2d\uff2b\u69cb\u9020_eng.docx", "file_type": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document", "file_size": 197019, "creation_date": "2025-08-15", "last_modified_date": "2025-08-15"}, "hash": "28736af3d649bf710794cfee0f43d1da9631bf6d0fa1a37b598535c36c148bff", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}]}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "\"Healthy,\" \"Slim and sharp,\" \"A small gift,\" \"A unique snack.\"\n\n\"Sorry it always sells out!\" \"Vegan food!\" \"Cute!\" \"Colorful\"\n\n\"Nut collection,\" \"Made in India,\" \"Ethnic.\"\n\n\n\nCorners like this are displayed here and there.\n\nI picked up the product, wondering what it was.\n\nFeeling adventurous, I toss my purchases into the basket.\n\n\n\nThis experience can be repeated several times and become a brand.\n\nOnce this brand takes root, word of mouth will spread.\n\nWord of mouth is the best way to gain new customers.\n\n\n\nA brand is more than just a name for a product.\n\nSomething that stirs the emotions of customers .\n\n\n\nTo do this, it is important to provide a good experience.\n\nA dedicated buyer will be appointed to develop the corner.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCustomer First\n\nCustomer First: The engine that drives company growth\n\n\n\nAn article I read in the Nikkei Shimbun newspaper \"My Resume\" (July 21, 2025).\n\n\"NTT Docomo's President Nakamura called former Shiseido Chairman Moto Uotani, saying that our company is not customer-oriented and that he wanted us to guide the company to become more customer-oriented. And so began the 1,000-day challenge to become more customer-oriented. The company must change to become more customer-oriented. Marketing is management itself! We have begun management reforms to establish customer-oriented management.\"\n\n\n\nDelighting customers, building trust, and growing them into lifelong customers. Customer-first philosophy.\n\nDoes customer first make a company grow?\n\nWhat does customer first mean?\n\nSince this does not exist in Japan, we will learn from the US example.\n\nTo become the number one customer-oriented company in Japan.\n\n\n\nNo matter what anyone says, Nordstrom is the number one company\n\nHe has a legendary reputation for his customer service.\n\nNordstrom Department Stores currently operates over 100 stores across the United States.\n\n1901. In the 1980s, it expanded to include clothing and other products. It grew into a department store. Nordstrom was founded by Nordstrom, a Swedish immigrant who opened a shoe store.\n\nIn his book \"When Service Becomes Legend,\"\n\nIt said that their motto is \"not to outmart (outsmart others with strategies), but to provide outservice (service that goes beyond service).\"\n\n\u3000\n\nThe president's welcoming speech to new employees reads as follows:\n\n\"Welcome to Nordstrom.\" It's a pleasure to have you here. At Nordstrom, our number one goal is to provide the best possible service to our customers. We expect you to aim high, both personally and professionally. You can achieve high goals. At our company, you make decisions all the time. Use your excellent judgment. Other than that, there are no rules at Nordstrom. When in doubt, don't be afraid to ask your manager, anytime, anywhere.\"\n\nEmployee training is only one day long, and there is no work manual.\n\nNordstrom introduced the \"inverted pyramid\" organization in 1971. Up until then, there had been no organizational charts. The inverted pyramid organization has customers at the top, salespeople below them, department managers, store managers, product managers, and buyers. At the very bottom is the president and board of directors.\n\n\n\nThere are only two types of jobs: the front line, which serves customers directly, and a set of jobs that serve front-line employees.\n\nThe president does not reign at the top of the organizational pyramid. The sales staff who interact with customers make their own judgments and decisions and respond to customers accordingly.\n\n\n\nI heard the following stories directly from sales staff and store service managers:\n\n\n\nI realized I had left my airline ticket on the counter. I told my colleague, \"Please help me at the counter!\" and drove to the airport in my car to deliver the ticket to the customer. I delivered it safely.\n\n\n\nA customer came in to return a tire. \"How much did you pay for it?\" Customer: \"$65.\"\n\nThe salesperson took $65 from the register and refunded it, even though I didn't have a purchase receipt or anything.\n\nThey didn't ask for it. The customer is right. Nordstrom doesn't sell tires.\n\n\n\nAn elderly man told a salesman he couldn't find his car (large parking lot in the US).\n\nThe salesperson immediately contacted the customer manager. The manager then asked someone who was available to help and searched the parking lot until they found the item. Later, the grandfather sent a thick thank-you letter in the mail. In it, he wrote, \"I've never bought from Nordstrom before, but I'll buy from Nordstrom from now on.\" The service manager said it was the happiest thing that had ever happened to him.\n\n\n\nThe Nordstrom manager, who I met for lunch at a lecture at Seibu Department Store, asked if the tire refund was true.\n\n\"It's true,\" was the answer. \"You'll lose money!\" was the question. \"You also give lectures and talk about tires. People all over the world will spread the word. How much is that worth?\" was the reply.\n\nI learned about this value. Apparently, many people hear about Nordstrom and visit the store to \"try it out.\" It's a difficult time to acquire new customers. This case explains why word of mouth is the most powerful tool for acquiring new customers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMitchell, a men's clothing specialty store with only three stores Customer First\n\nJack Mitchell's Customer-Focused Management\n\n\"My Ultimate Service: How 94% of Customers Say They're Satisfied\" by Jack Mitchell .\n\nIn 1958, my father opened the store that would become Mitchell's, a two-store men's clothing specialty store.\n\nThe customer database contains 115,000 customers. Customer lists and purchase data from both stores are stored in the database. The president and all executives are on the sales floor. It's a customer-oriented business. Naturally. They treat customers as if they were inviting them to their homes.\n\n\n\nPresident Mitchell's morning.\n\nLook at detailed data on customers who purchased over $2,000 the previous day. While sipping the first cup of coffee, find out the customer's name, the name of the staff member who served them, and the brand of the product that sold. While sipping the second cup of coffee, compare this month's sales with last year's. Afterwards, make a thank-you call and send a thank-you letter. Customer first is a natural obligation. Actions to retain customers.\n\n\n\nMitchell's winning strategy\n\nAlways maintain the highest level\n\nMaintaining industry-leading margins\n\nDon't make expenditures that don't impact customers\n\nEnd of season, zero inventory\n\nEven if the store is closed, someone always answers the phone when a customer calls. If the president isn't there, it's number two. If number two isn't there, the call goes to number three. The person who receives the call rushes to the store, opens the shutters, and waits for the customer. This is unthinkable behavior. They're taking unthinkable actions.\n\n\n\nA client spills coffee in the car on the way to a friend's wedding. There's nothing you can do.\n\nHe calls Mitchell, saying he knows they can do something about it. He opens the shutters and waits, even though it's his day off. He calls the suit seamstress. He can't wear a formal suit with coffee spilled on it. He measures the customer. He selects a suit from the suits in stock that is close to the measurements. The seamstress rushes to make it. The customer says it arrived in time for the wedding. There are many stories like this in his book.\n\n\n\n\n\nSouthwest Airlines Customer First\n\nThis airline has grown rapidly using the following strategies and tactics:\n\nThis shows the company's management philosophy of concentration and its thorough commitment to service.\n\nFlights must be on time. Delays in departure and arrival in the US are common. Customers must be patient and persevere.\n\nNo reserved seats. Sit wherever you like. Low fares.\n\nThere is no in-flight meal , and only one aircraft model is available (limited maintenance and inspections are required for this model, allowing for inspections to be completed in a short period of time).\n\nThey state that employees come first and customers second.\n\nHe spends more time planning company parties than drafting business policies. He creates advertisements that make fun of his company, employees, and acquaintances.\n\nCEO Harp Carey has employees appear at interviews in jackets and Bermuda shorts. This is truly \"outrageous.\" Boeing 737 aircraft painted in various colors.\n\nFlight attendants in mini dresses, flight attendants who surprise passengers by popping their heads out of the overhead bins, and female employees who show up in full military gear... We have created a corporate environment where people can freely express their ideas.\n\n\n\nSafety is not the focus of work. Enjoyment is the focus. Employee-oriented printed materials such as company newsletters, pamphlets, and videos amount to 642 pages per employee per year.\n\nsends out 75,000 congratulatory cards to customers, employees, and friends for birthdays, wedding anniversaries, baby births, and other special occasions . On Valentine's Day, the company presents the \"Heart Hero Award\" to employees who make outstanding contributions behind the scenes. The award ceremony is held in a large-scale event in the main lobby of the company's headquarters. The company has achieved excellent results by putting into practice ideas not discussed in business management or marketing theory.\n\n\n\n\n\nScandinavian Airlines CEO Jan Carlsson: \" Moment of Truth\"\n\nof Truth Of Truth\n\nFrontline employees are told that the 15 seconds of customer service they receive can determine the success of a company.\n\nThe moment of truth is 15 seconds. You have 15 seconds to finish the customer off.\n\nThe Moment of Truth is the final blow. The moment of truth. It's a term used in bullfighting.\n\nto make a good or bad impression on a customer .\n\nIt only takes a split second to decide whether to turn a customer into a lifelong enemy or a friend.

Picture\" Six Big Boxes\n\nMarketing is How to proceed? About HOW\u3000\n\nMarketing System It consists of six boxes\n\n\n\nAuthor Krusti L. Nordheim.\n\nHe attended various marketing courses, read Kotler's \"Principles of Marketing,\" and studied various marketing books, but the theories were all scattered, and he was completely unable to understand what marketing was. There was no system for marketing. Although there were theoretical books on the steps to implementing marketing, there were no books that could serve as practical references.\n\n\n\nNordheim wrote at the beginning of this book that his research led him to the six big pictures he will now describe.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe six boxes are as shown in the figure.\n\nFirst, business goals: this year's sales target, profit target, operating profit margin\n\nSecond, marketing goals: number of new customers acquired, retention rate of existing customers, lifetime value per customer (=CLV)\n\nThird, source of volume: capturing market share\n\nFourth: STP; segmentation, targeting target customers, customer appeal positioning. Three initial letters of STP.\n\n5. Execution: Manufacturing and selling food, clothing, and shelter products, purchasing and selling food, clothing, and shelter products, and providing leisure and other services\n\n6. Evaluation: Did you achieve your goal of acquiring new customers? Did you achieve a 100% customer retention rate?\n\nHas the lifetime value per customer increased?\n\nFor all customer promotions implemented, was the return on investment (ROI) for the promotional investment amount 35% or more (said to be the pass mark)?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne is a box called Business Goals\n\n\n\nIdentify our areas of expertise, the most profitable product lineups, and categories. For example, what products are customers happy to buy? Which departments are our best buyers in charge of?\n\nDecide on your sales strategy. Will you appeal to low prices? EDLP? Or a wide range of value-added products?\n\nMake the most possible sales your business goal.\n\nMarketing is demand creation = customer creation. In retail store sales (real stores)\n\nDemand = Number of customers x CLV (lifetime value per customer) x Number of stores\n\nFor non-store sales (online sales)\n\nDemand = Number of small customers x CLV (lifetime value per customer)\n\n\n\nLifetime value per customer, not just the purchase amount per customer.\n\nOperating profit is the amount obtained by subtracting total sales expenses (cost of goods + promotional expenses) from the sales amount for the year.\n\nThis is called Net Profit Value (NPV). NPV divided by the number of customers\n\nThe number is the lifetime value per customer, or CLV.\n\nStore sales case: Sales = Number of customers x CLV x Number of stores\n\n1 million yen = 100 people x 10,000 yen x 1 store\n\n1 million yen = 200 people x 10,000 yen x 1 store\n\n1 million yen = 100 people x 20,000 yen x 1 store\n\n1 million yen = 100 people x 10,000 yen x 2 stores\n\n1 million yen = 200 people x 20,000 yen x 2 stores\n\n\n\nBusinesses must decide which strategy to use to achieve their goals: increasing customer numbers, increasing CLV per customer, or increasing the number of stores. Do they need to achieve all three? It's difficult. Focus on one.\n\nFirst, one.\n\n\n\nNumber of customers = Number of new customers acquired + Number of existing customers - Number of customers who have defected\n\n\n\nIf you want to increase the number of customers, should you acquire new customers or eliminate customer defections?\n\nIf you think it will be difficult to increase customer numbers, your marketing strategy should be to increase CLV by 5% from the previous year.\n\nIf you have the financial means, opening new stores or making acquisitions are growth strategies. So which one should you choose?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsecond box is called Marketing Objectives.\n\nMarketing goals. Let's think about what our marketing goals are. What kind of customers should we target? Young, middle-aged, mature (= middle-aged).\n\nWhat is the average number of customers per store?\n\nWhat is the goal for how many new customers to acquire each year? Keep the customer churn rate at 5%. If the churn rate is 5%, CLV will decrease if that number of new customers are not acquired. Marketing goals include the number of new customers to acquire and a 95% retention rate for existing customers.\n\nThe marketing goal is to increase CLV figures by 5% from the previous year.\n\n\n\nThe number of customers is: Number of customers = Number of new customers + Number of existing customers - Number of defecting customers\n\n\n\nAcquire 10% of the number of new customers from the previous year. \tThis is a difficult challenge in this day and age.\n\nAchieving a 100% retention rate for existing customers \t\tis also difficult. Usually, 15% of customers leave.\n\nA 5% increase in CLV per customer \tcompared to the previous year is feasible compared to the above two.\n\n\n\nCustomers are new and existing customers\n\nIt is said that it costs five times as much to sell to a new customer as it does to sell to an existing customer.\n\nA 5% improvement in customer churn rates among existing customers will increase profits by at least 25%.\n\n(\"Customer Loyalty Management\" Diamond Publishing)\n\nThe more customers continue to purchase from you, the more profit you can make from them.\n\nOn the other hand, if a customer stops buying after one purchase, the costs incurred to acquire them cannot be recovered.\n\nThe main theme of the marketing goal is\n\nExisting customer retention rate: It's a difficult task, but we aim for 100%.\n\nCustomer retention is the ultimate marketing goal.\n\n\n\nA talk by the CEO of Netscape Communications.\n\nWhen I asked a new employee, \"What is the purpose of the business?\", he answered, \"To make money.\"\n\n\"No, our goal is to acquire and retain customers,\" he instructed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe third box is called Volume Source.\n\n\n\nWhere does the sales come from?\n\nFrom selling products. From selling goods. From selling service goods.\n\nWell, that's true, but we also need to have a more strategic perspective.\n\nWhat are the high-volume categories?\n\nIf it's a department store, should it be foreign brands like Hermes, cosmetics, jewelry for the wealthy, duty-free goods for inbound tourists, or underground food?\n\nIt has further been subdivided into fashion items such as overseas brands, clothing such as bags, and cosmetics.\n\n\n\nIf it's a supermarket, do you buy meat, vegetables, fresh fish, or prepared foods?\n\nFurther granularity: meat steak or grilled meat, fresh bluefin tuna, prepared food or bento\n\n\n\nIf it's a service\n\nDomestic and international travel, theater, sports, live music, musicals?\n\n\n\nSales volume by category, percentage of total sales for each category,\n\nFurthermore, who are the target customers for creating volume? Are they young, middle-aged, or machucas (elderly)? What is the main trade area or region?\n\n\n\nWe will explore these issues in our marketing efforts.\n\nThis specific consideration moves to the fourth box, STP Strategy.\n\nThere are three small boxes in the fourth large box.\n\nOne is segmentation \tstrategy\n\nThe second is targeting strategy \t.\n\nThe third is positioning strategy \t.\n\nThe three initials stand for STP.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFour are STP boxes, three small boxes\n\nOne of them is segmentation\n\n\n\nWhy do we need to segment?\n\nThat's because thinking that all customers are the same, that an unspecified number of people are all customers, is not efficient and results in inefficient return on investment (POI).\n\nThis is because promotional campaigns that involve throwing things around often waste promotional funds. The aim is to concentrate promotional funds on customer segments with the greatest opportunities. This is marketing. The aim is to focus on customers and regions with the greatest opportunities. This is the way business and marketing should be.\n\n\n\nThe main segmentation patterns are by customer and region.\n\nCustomer segmentation includes age, generation, life stage, lifestyle, etc.\n\nAges include 20s, 30s, 40s, 50s, 60s, 70s, etc.\n\nIn terms of life stages, there are single, newlywed, first child, two-generation family, children leaving home and becoming a married couple again, mature (= elderly generation), etc.\n\nLifestyle segmentation: There is also lifestyle segmentation that assumes lifestyle habits based on purchased product data. Convenience store lover, meat lover, bento lover, vegetarian, bulk purchase lover, fruit lover, bulk purchase lover, etc.\n\n\n\n\n\nRegional Segmentation\n\nIn the Kanto region, Shibuya, Shinjuku, Minato, Chiyoda, Setagaya, Adachi, Itabashi, and Arakawa\n\nThe characteristics of customers who live along the Seibu Line, Toyoko Line, Tokyu Line, Kawagoe Line, etc. can be determined to some extent.\n\n\n\nIn Kansai\n\nAmagasaki, Nishinomiya, Ashiya, south of Namba and north of Umeda. There are differences in the shirts and suits worn.\n\nNara, Kyoto, Toyonaka, Ikeda, Takatsuki, Sakai, Matsubara.\n\nThere are also differences along the Hankyu lines (Kobe Line and Kyoto Line), Nankai lines, Kintetsu lines, and subway lines.\n\nWhich customer profile should be carefully selected for volume? Young, middle-aged, or mature elderly?\n\nWhich areas and residents along the railway line will be the source of volume?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4 STP boxes 3 small boxes\n\nNumber 2: Targeting\u3000\n\n\n\nDetermine where our opportunities lie in customer segmentation.\n\nAssessment of segment volume sources.\n\nAre they over 60? Or maybe in their 40s or 50s?\n\nAre you at the single stage, the first child birth stage, or perhaps even the mature stage (i.e. older generation)?\n\n\n\nIn which product categories do we have volume opportunities?\n\nDrill down to the finer details to determine opportunities.\n\n\n\nIn regional segmentation, Shibuya Ward, Minato Ward, Setagaya Ward,\n\nAs for railway lines, should we focus on the Tokyu line? Tokyu stores are located along the Tokyu line. In that case, we should consider areas around stations on the Seibu line that offer high opportunities as our main areas.\n\nIn the Kansai region, we are considering Nishinomiya, Toyonaka, H2O Izumiya Hankyu Kansai Supermarket, OK is also building a new store, can we beat OK EDLP? We will consider other segment opportunities.\n\n\n\nThere is a database that stores receipt data. If not, use the Jericho Cloud service.\n\n\n\na \"region/age matrix\" that displays the number of customers purchasing by region and age group and their composition ratio (ratio of customers by region and age group to the store total), as well as the purchase amount and its composition ratio (same as above).\n\n\n\nThis information is used to specify the product and service menu.\n\nEnter the main source of sales volume, such as meat, bento, or Japanese daily products.\n\nCustomer segment/regional segment. Set segments with a high number of customers and their composition ratio, as well as segments with a high purchase amount and their composition ratio as your main targets.\n\n\n\nRather than relying on intuition, you should refer to the results of customer demand over the past year or so, and specifically and objectively determine which demand opportunities to target. This is how marketing is implemented.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4 STP boxes 3 small boxes\n\nNo. 3: Positioning\u3000\n\n\n\nCompetitor companies sell similar products in similar shelf layouts and with similar sales floor layouts.\n\nWe segmented customers and regions and considered opportunities for each segment.\n\nThis is not enough. We are selling the same products in the same way as our competitors, and using the same sales promotion methods. We have segmented, targeted, and decided to target segments that offer the greatest opportunity for investment in sales promotion funds. This is not enough.\n\n\n\nThere is an easy-to-understand example.\n\nPositioning done by American Dial Soap.\n\n\"Skin-beautifying effect\" for women. \"Body odor prevention\" for men. But we don't just sell soap.\n\nCoca-Cola. \"A refreshing Coca-Cola!\" \"Coca-Cola to quench your thirst!\"\n\nPositioning is effective in stimulating customers' subconscious minds.\n\n\"Buy soap\" and \"Buy Coca-Cola\" are already ingrained in the brain in the subconscious mind. Soap, Coca-Cola. Customer needs are soap, Coca-Cola.\n\nIt is said that the conscious mind accounts for 5% and the subconscious mind accounts for 95%.\n\nPositioning stimulates 95% of the subconscious mind.\n\nIn the parcel delivery industry, FedEx has long ago implemented a service called \"delivery within three days from order.\"\n\nPositioning will be such as \"Delivery within 3 hours and 30 minutes of the afternoon of the next day after ordering.\"\n\nPositioning can be done through things like a free return guarantee, a 24-hour inquiry service, a dedicated toll-free number service, or a free lifetime warranty.\n\n\n\nOur sales floor development and product assortment positioning.\n\nConsider the positioning of each product sold.\n\nSelling point = Keywords = Cache copy = POP = Positioning\n\nPositioning creation. Other companies may soon imitate and follow suit.\n\nEven so, the original pioneering company will be questioned by the media and remembered by customers.\n\nThe first one to arrive wins.\n\n\n\nPositioning Setting Tips\n\nThink carefully about the benefits of the product, write them down in a notebook, and then make a decision.\n\nProducts are bundles of benefits\n\nBenefit = convenience. Hammer = benefit of hammering nails\n\nThe benefits of a car are: you can get to your destination quickly, you can drive with your girlfriend, it's convenient for shopping, and many more.\n\nWhat benefits does the product or item you are selling offer?\n\nMarketing is about how (channel), how much (price), and what kind of promotion a product or item will be sold - Kotler's 4Ps are not marketing.\n\nPositioning is about what message to send to stimulate the subconscious mind about the value (added value) of a product or item.\n\n\n\nCoca-Cola \"quenches thirst.\" Soap for women \"beautiful skin\" and men \"prevents body odor.\"\n\nViagra \"Sexual Performance\" \"Couples Experience Pleasure\".\n\nRed sports car: \"Attracts interest from women who are out of reach\" and \"Secures a lover\"\n\n\n\nBenefits can be divided into functional benefits and emotional benefits.\n\nThe functional benefits of a car are transporting people and goods. Safety, operability, and fuel efficiency are also functional benefits.\n\nThe emotional benefit is the sense of belonging that comes from wanting to ride in the same car as other people.\n\nToyota's Lexus, Nissan's Bluebird, EV company \"Tesla,\" etc. are all things I aspire to.\n\nWe propose a close link between functional benefits and emotional benefits.\n\n\n\nSupermarkets and drugstores.\n\n\"A slim and toned body\" is a vegetarian diet = vegetables, fruits, and almond milk\n\n\"Vegetarianism is good for preventing illness\" = Tomatoes, spinach and soy milk\n\n\"Anti-aging\" = Meatless Monday = Paul McCartney\n\n(Meatless Mondays, a movement spreading around the world)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFive big boxes called \"Do\" and four small boxes inside them.\n\nProduct service, price, channel, and promotion\n\n\n\nThe execution here refers to the execution of marketing goals, including the segmentation, targeting, and positioning that have been set to achieve the marketing goals.\n\n\n\nProduct (= goods), service product box\n\nDeciding what products to purchase and how to arrange the product lineup in order to acquire new customers, retain existing customers, and prevent defections.\n\nWe purchase and stock our products with an eye to what products will be most suitable for the target age group or life stage.\n\nThe same idea applies to service products.\n\nFor example, for mature people (those aged 65 and over),\n\nWe offer a selection of healthy products, and for the child-rearing stage, we offer a selection of easy-to-eat, timeless products.\n\nFor mature customers, we offer service products such as cruises around Japan and cruises in the Aegean Sea.\n\nIn addition, to attract new customers, we introduce and stock products that cannot be purchased at other stores.\n\nTo retain existing customers, measures such as using receipt data to position products with \"high purchase rates and high repeat rates\" on POP displays will be implemented to prevent customer defections.\n\n\n\nPrice: Consideration and implementation of sales price\n\nNewly introduced products will be sold at special prices to attract new customers.\n\nOne method of setting prices is to set 5% of the products in the assortment at the same price as cost, 10% at 10% above cost, 15% at 20% above cost, 15% at 30% above cost, and the remaining 50% at 35% above cost, etc. This is the kind of pricing policy we will implement.\n\nAnother thing to consider when setting prices is by item (natto, tofu, yogurt, etc.).\n\nPrices are determined and implemented using Priceline's three-tier pricing principle: \"lower price, middle price, upper price.\"\n\n\n\nRunning a channel\n\nThis will be implemented through a retail sales channel that only sells in real stores (= analog stores).\n\nThis will be implemented through a channel that sells only online (=digital) sales.\n\nIt will be sold through a dual channel (omnibus) of physical stores and online sales.\n\nThere are three main channels.\n\nDecide which of the three channels is right for your company and implement it.\n\nThe marketing objectives include acquiring new customers, retaining existing customers, and preventing customer churn. The evaluation of these objectives is explained in Box 6.\n\nThe standard is to evaluate at the end of the year, but if the fiscal year ends, progress observation is not possible. I would like to observe progress over the course of the period. There is a way to do this.\n\nRegardless of the fiscal year, it is the previous year and the current year. For example, if it is the end of September this year, specify the period from October of last year to September of this year.\n\n\"Purchase Amount by Amount Rank\" information. This information allows you to understand the number of new customers acquired and the number of customers who have defected. It is also possible to understand the number of new customers acquired and the number of customers who have defected in the nine months from the beginning of the year to the current month (end of September). Use this information to monitor progress.\n\n\n\nPromotion Execution\n\nThe newly introduced product is Decile 1, Decile 2, and Decile 3 for 30% of customers based on the \"Decile Analysis\" information.\n\nNew product introduction proposals will be implemented through direct mail promotions.\n\n, promotions are carried out by sending direct mail about \"new products\" to customers in the 1st to 3rd deciles of each sales floor (= shop) .\n\n\n\n\"RFM Cell\" information is effective for promotions to prevent defection .\n\nThe number of customers displayed in RFM cell and BB cell are customers who have not yet completely defected but are showing signs of defecting.\n\nIf we offer a product to this number of customers, there is a possibility that more than 50% of them will return.\n\nIf left unattended, they will completely abandon you and you will lose your existing customers.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 18964, "metadata_seperator":

Evaluation of marketing activities A box called\n\n\n\nBoxes 1 to 6 are arranged in a row, flowing from upstream to downstream of a river.\n\nIn other words, the sixth box is organically connected.\n\nIt starts with business goals, followed by marketing goals, volume sources, STP, execution, and evaluation.\n\nThe process is goal, plan, execute, and evaluate.\n\nis the assessment of the results of planning and execution .\n\nDid you increase the number of new customers you acquired by 10% compared to the previous year?\n\nPreviously, we had 10% of our goal of 5,000 existing customers. Were we able to acquire 500 new customers?\n\nThe goal is to retain existing customers at 100%. Have we achieved 100% retention?\n\nIf it was only 90%, that would be a 10% decrease from 5,000 people.\n\nThis year, there were 4,500 purchasing customers.\n\nIf you were able to acquire 500 new customers, a 10% increase, you would make up for the 500 customers who defected, bringing your current customer count to 5,000. This means that 500 customers will have been replaced from the previous year. However, if you only gained 200 new customers, you would lose 300 customers this year. This would bring your current customer count to 4,200. This would mean a 16% customer attrition rate. CLV would fall by the amount of the decrease in customer count.\n\n\n\nSo far, we have looked at data for one year's total for each store. This is still insufficient. What caused the decrease in customers? We need more in-depth data (i.e., customer analysis information by amount rank) to determine whether new customer acquisition was on target.\n\nSupermarkets, drug stores, and home centers are sorted by department, class, and item. Department stores include Louis Vuitton, Hermes, shoe departments, bag departments, Kana Shojuan, Bunmeido, and Juchheim.\n\n\n\nBy department, and then by subdivision of the department (designating the department, then the subdivision).\n\nIn department stores, there are shoe sections, bag sections, sections by shop, such as Kana Shojuan, Bunmeido, and Hermes.\n\n\n\nBy specifying the period from January to December last year and this year, or from January to June or the first half or second half of July to December, the number of new customers acquired, the number of customers who have defected, and the total number of customers who have made purchases this year (= number of existing customers) can be displayed for each sales area in just three minutes.\n\n\n\nIf the number of new customers acquired is low, such as zero customer defections, then the sales floor or shop has very high customer satisfaction.\n\nIf the opposite were true, it could be evaluated as a sales area where customers are dissatisfied.\n\n\n\nOnce a year, the number of new customers acquired, the number of defected customers, and customers who have spent over 1 million yen on all sales floors are displayed on a single screen, along with customer rankings by purchase amount.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is also a way to target people based on their life stage.\n\nOne of the segmentations: life stage\n\n\n\nLife Stage Segmentation Part 1\n\nLife, from the cradle to the grave. As we grow, we experience different stages.\n\nBaby stage. Toddler stage, elementary school, junior high school, high school, and university learning stages.\n\nThe single stage, the life stage of a newly married couple (newlyweds), the stage of raising children, the stage of family growth with the birth of a second child, the stage of children moving out, and the stage of old age. Everyone experiences the life cycle of life.\n\nDepending on the stage you are in, your emotions, desires, needs, and wants will be different.\n\nIn his book \"Career Couples,\" which describes the roles of men and women in the new era, he describes life stages as follows:\n\nThe couple stage (starting at marriage and up to the birth of the first child), the expansion stage (from the birth of the first child to the birth of the second child), the peak stage (when there are two or more preschool-aged children), the full house stage (until the first child leaves home), the contraction stage (ending when the last child moves out), and the empty family stage (when all the children have left).\n\n\n\n\n\nLife Stage Segmentation Part 2\n\nSegmentation by generation, also known as generational marketing.\n\nA marketing method that treats generations as a single group.\n\nBaby Boomers, second generation baby boomers, Generation Z, Millennials, etc.\n\nBaby boomer Taichi Sakaiya published a book titled \"The Baby Boomer Generation,\" which became a huge bestseller.\n\n\n\nGeneration Z refers to those born between the late 1990s and early 2010s. As of 2025, they are between the ages of 13 and 29.\n\nThey are also known as digital natives, who grew up in an environment where the internet and smartphones were widespread from an early age, and social natives who are adept at using social media.\n\nA generation that flocks to the city's downtown areas .\n\n\n\nMillennials are people born between the 1980s and mid-1990s, experienced the spread of digital technology, and are adept at using social media. As of 2025, they will be between 35 and 45 years old. They are the generation that primarily raises children. Many women are unmarried, and many are working. They are the main consumers. Known as the \"king of singers, \" Lady Gaga (born March 28, 1986) is an American singer-songwriter, music producer, actress, businesswoman, and philanthropist, and is said to be a representative of the millennial generation.\n\n\n\nLife Stage Segmentation Part 3\n\nAll developed countries are simultaneously entering an aging society, and are said to be living in an aging society with a declining birthrate.\n\nJapan is at the forefront, followed by China, South Korea, North Korea, etc. Countries with large immigrant populations, Asia, Africa, and India are developing countries. Japan's major retailers are competing to enter Asian countries and India in search of growth.\n\n\n\nThe largest population in Japan is 36.96 million people aged 65 or over. The values of this elderly generation are said to be as follows:\n\nYoung people simply focused on price when making their purchases, but older people value value over price.\n\nBased on past purchase experiences, they feel dissatisfied or lacking in bargain items. They place importance on value.\n\nDuring your working life, you have three places: work, family, and friends. When you retire, you lose your workplace. You make up for it with the two remaining circles. You tend to prefer social circles.\n\nThey like independence. They stick to their own ideas. They make their own decisions. They are not easily influenced by the opinions of others. They have a desire to live independently, both mentally and physically, without relying on others.\n\n\n\nIt's a common misconception that retirement causes the brain of an older person to hibernate until death.\n\nThis is far from the truth. Mature people have time for themselves. They can expand their horizons in new ways, big and small. They have renewed energy and an eye for expanding their knowledge. They have a desire to learn and expand their horizons.\n\n\n\nWith age comes a wealth of wisdom and experience, and I feel happy when people ask me to share my hard-earned experience and knowledge.\n\nThey would be pleased if they were given the opportunity to show respect and act as mentors and advisors. The distribution industry needs to develop marketing that targets more middle-aged people (i.e., mature people). There is little knowledge about the psychology and strengths of the elderly.\n\n\n\nLife Stage Segmentation Part 4\n\nIntergenerational values are called cohorts.\n\nA cohort is a group of people who grew up in the same era and were influenced by the same external events that shaped their lives as they grew older.\n\nThe US middle-aged cohort is defined as follows:\n\nA group born before the mid-1920s who grew up in the midst of the Great Depression.\n\nThis generation was born in the late 1920s and early 1930s and was less affected by the Great Depression during their youth, but was heavily affected by World War II.\n\nThe generation born during peacetime from the late 1930s to 1946 is known as the Silent Generation.\n\nThe youngest generation are baby boomers, born after 1946.\n\nThey were an unprecedented generation in American history who were influenced by hippie culture around the time of the Vietnam War (1950s).\n\nThe older generation, who lived through the Great Depression, sees debt as almost a crime.\n\n65 have no debt, including paid-off mortgages.\n\nBaby boomers, the youngest generation, rely on credit as a financial tool. They spend a lot on repayment (payment on credit), making them a valuable consumer for retailers like Walmart.\n\n\n\nLife Stage Conclusions;\n\nConsider the department you are in charge of and which stage you want to target.\n\nBuyers, what product are you currently purchasing? What stage is it for?\n\nSales representative: What stage is the product you just picked up aimed at?\n\nWhen selling something, you have to be conscious of your customers. Who you are selling to, who you want to buy,\n\nIf you purchase, display, and sell products without this in mind, you will not be able to attract many customers.\n\nBe strongly aware of segmentation, targeting, positioning, and STP.\n\n\n\nThere is also a way to target people based on their lifestyle .\n\nOne of the segmentations: Lifestyle\n\n\n\nIn order to satisfy customer needs, marketing that focuses on the customer's lifestyle is a marketing method that allows you to get closer to customers than just their life stage.\n\nconsumers from a psychological perspective.\n\nSociologist D.G. Moore defines lifestyle as \"a patterned way of living.\" Psychologist G.W. Allport defines it as \"a view of life and values that are gradually formed in the course of life .\" Customers are human beings with emotions. Different people feel differently.\n\n\n\nThe lifestyles of the pre-war and post-war generations\n\nFrugality is the motto, hard work and savings. Sacrificing today for tomorrow's happiness. Emphasizing human bonds. Living peacefully with family and the community. A world of \"we.\" Currently, a world of \"I am me.\" Putting others on the back burner. It's even worse than that. Indifferent to others. It's okay as long as you're having fun. Not interested in the person living next door. Don't say hello.\n\nAt home, locked in my room, staring at my smartphone. While walking down the street, riding my bike. Is there urgent news? A friend sitting next to me. We're talking on our smartphones. It's not really a discussion. The family is falling apart. The daughter and son are mentally independent. A lifestyle where money is the purpose of life. The elderly are seen as a social scourge. The internet society is creating complex lifestyles. Nearly 100% of food purchases are made at convenience stores.\n\nA young person died from some reason. A certain monk said, \"It doesn't decay easily.\" That's right, there are a lot of preservatives in the body. A slice of bread from a convenience store doesn't grow blue mold even after a week.\n\n\n\nWe will provide a detailed explanation of lifestyle segmentation and targeting.\n\nThe lifestyle segment has the advantage of being able to extract customers who more closely match their needs.\n\nIn department stores, the divisions by brand and sales floor are similar to lifestyles. The sales floors are divided into categories based on what people want to buy. Ferragamo, Chanel, Christian Dior, Louis Vuitton, Coach, Clinic, Ralph Lauren, Kenzo, Sanrio, Miki House, Kana Shojuan, Bunmeido, Minamoto Kitchoan, Juchheim, Godiva, Morozoff, etc. The sales floor itself reflects customer needs.\n\n\n\nHome centers stock products related to professional construction, kids' hobbies, gardening, outdoor leisure, pet life, DIY, cycling, interior design, farming, kitchens, bathrooms and toilets, home appliances, organization, and more.\n\nCustomers who buy drills and saws are registered with the \"Construction Pro\" lifestyle.\n\nCustomers who buy things like flower seeds and lawnmowers are considered to have a \"gardening\" lifestyle.\n\n\n\nAt a drugstore, customers who buy energy drinks are considered \"energy drinkers , \" customers who buy anti-aging supplements are considered \"anti-aging\" lifestyle, and customers who buy diet-related products are considered \"diet\" lifestyle.\n\n\n\nAs for supermarkets, let us introduce the lifestyle initiatives undertaken by their headquarters in London, UK.\n\n\"Convenience Store,\" \"Cooking,\" \"Healthy,\" \"Big Box,\" \"Small Foods,\" \"Green\"\n\nIt defined around 30 lifestyles, including \" fruit,\" \"low price,\" \"private brand,\" \"value foods,\" \"traditional,\" \"latch box,\" \"ethnic,\" \"high price,\" \"meat,\" and \"vegetarian.\"\n\n\n\nis assigned 30 lifestyle codes such as \"This is meat,\" \"This product is a high-end accessory,\" or \"This product is a health food.\"\n\nThe receipt detail data will reveal the lifestyle code, and purchases with a high number of that code will correspond to the appropriate lifestyle.\n\n\n\nLifestyle Customer Identification, developed by Jericho Consulting, takes a different approach to identifying lifestyles.\n\nFor example, customers who buy more than 20 items from the prepared food section per month are classified as \"convenience type,\" while customers who buy Tomaru udon soup, miso, soy sauce, and olive oil are classified as \"kitchen type\" or \"cooking type.\"\n\nA lifestyle bar for registering such things is displayed on the screen.\n\n\n\nBy specifying a three-month period and clicking the \"Cooking\" bar, customers who have purchased over 100,000 yen worth of products such as Tomaru Udon soup and miso from the receipt data stored in the database will be classified as cooking lovers.\n\nThe number of customers is counted, and if there are 50, the bar displays 50. By displaying a list of 50 people, you can extract 50 customers as promotional targets.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStanford Research Institute (SRI) spent over 10 years\n\nAnalysis of purchasing data from thousands of Americans, categorization into nine lifestyle patterns\n\n\n\nResearch has begun to prove Maslow's \"Five-stage pyramid of needs.\"\n\nMaslow explained the five levels of human needs in \"The Complete Man,\" published in 1964. The book became a hot topic around the world. The five levels begin with \"physiological needs,\" then move on to \"safety needs,\" and then to the even higher level of \"social conformity needs.\" Next comes \"ego needs,\" which are the desire to be recognized by others, and at the top of the pyramid is the need for self-actualization.\n\nThe Stanford Research Institute is a spade diagram, as shown in Figure.\n\nFrom the bottom up, Survivor, Sustainer, and Belonger.\n\nFrom there it splits into left and right.\n\nLeft: Emulator, Achiever.\n\nRight side: I Am Me, Experiential, Socially Conscious.\n\nThe top is integrated self-actualization.\n\nA group struggling to survive is called a survivor (to survive), a sustainer (to hang on) , and a conservative, traditional Belonger.\n\nEmulators are young people who strive to get ahead. Achievers are\n\nA middle-aged man who has been promoted to department manager and executive.\n\nOn the right are I Am Me. Achievers' children. Experimentalists are people seeking social experience, and Social Conscious are people with a high level of social awareness.\n\nMaintaining the global environment, curbing climate change, sustainability, SDGs.\n\nThe arrows in the diagram. Lifestyles move left and right, and up and down and left and right with social changes and changes in the times.\n\nWhat is particularly noteworthy is that compared to 50 years ago, the number of achievers (those with high salaries) has become extremely small and has shrunk. I Am Me is centered around many Z households.\n\nIt can be expected that the population below Belonger has increased significantly.\n\nMost of the 36.96 million people aged 65 or older are in this group. \"I am me\" is extremely individualistic. As long as I'm happy, other people don't matter.\n\nThe year is 2025, a time of rising prices, and the population is growing.The company is dealing with low-income people who are ``I am me'' (people who do not consume much material goods) and below the ``Belonger'' level.\n\nWe are now in an environment where marketing and CRM are becoming increasingly important.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAiming to attract customers through brand building\n\nAcquire new customers, maintain existing customer retention rates, and increase CLV\n\nBrand Thinking Use\n\n\n\nIf you have a brand, you can set your positioning.\n\nA brand is more than a product. It's something that is created in the minds of customers.\n\nWhen customers see a brand logo, they know what it is.\n\nNo explanation needed. Everyone knows it.\n\nFor example, when a housewife buys juice, a story emerges: \"Kids love it. It's good for your health!\"\n\n\n\nA brand communicates technology, quality, functional characteristics, benefits, and empathy to customers.\n\nA brand is a customer's \"memory aid,\" \"quality information,\" and \"basis for differentiation.\"\n\nA brand is something that motivates customers to buy.\n\n\n\nMercedes-Benz is prestigious. Sony is a pioneer. Kellogg is a familiar brand.\n\nKleenex is disposable. Harry Potter is a story. Nike is a sport.\n\nStarbucks is postmodern. Rolex is luxury. Tiffany is joy.\n\nDavid Beckham is an idol. Harley Davidson is a man. Guinness is overtime.\n\nAmazon is internet shopping. Domino's Pizza is home delivery.\n\n\n\nBrand Law\n\nA brand is powerful when it's focused. Create a word in the mind of your customers.\n\nThe easiest way to destroy a brand is to put it on every product.\n\nUse colors that are opposite to your competitors. Brands are names. Ultimately, a brand is a name.\n\nWhen deciding on a brand name, consider things like: is it easy to pronounce? Does it have a musical sound? Can you write it down after hearing it once? Is it easy to read? Does it speak clearly? Is it concise? Is it unique? Is it interesting? Does it feel authentic?\n\n\n\nBranding is about \"how it makes the customer feel.\" The manager of Walt Disney Attractions said, \"What we sell is happiness.\"", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 18533, "end_char_idx": 37425, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "00441128-d823-4872-9015-34db7dcb3154": {"__data__": {"id_": "00441128-d823-4872-9015-34db7dcb3154", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_name": "\uff2a\uff23\uff21\uff29\uff13\uff10\uff12\uff2d\uff2b\u69cb\u9020_eng.docx", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Admin\\Desktop\\Advanced-RAG\\MergingCode\\data\\\uff2a\uff23\uff21\uff29\uff13\uff10\uff12\uff2d\uff2b\u69cb\u9020_eng.docx", "file_type": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document", "file_size": 197019, "creation_date": "2025-08-15", "last_modified_date": "2025-08-15"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "505b2418-d6c0-49f9-8883-249f5ea0f8e3", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_name": "\uff2a\uff23\uff21\uff29\uff13\uff10\uff12\uff2d\uff2b\u69cb\u9020_eng.docx", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Admin\\Desktop\\Advanced-RAG\\MergingCode\\data\\\uff2a\uff23\uff21\uff29\uff13\uff10\uff12\uff2d\uff2b\u69cb\u9020_eng.docx", "file_type": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document", "file_size": 197019, "creation_date": "2025-08-15", "last_modified_date": "2025-08-15"}, "hash": "884e110f65af94908bce267b6fe0496b51cb442c0543e5b3e59b58348c44f49b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "acb9cdbc-dd31-4607-bed3-df743c48ed6a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_name": "\uff2a\uff23\uff21\uff29\uff13\uff10\uff12\uff2d\uff2b\u69cb\u9020_eng.docx", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Admin\\Desktop\\Advanced-RAG\\MergingCode\\data\\\uff2a\uff23\uff21\uff29\uff13\uff10\uff12\uff2d\uff2b\u69cb\u9020_eng.docx", "file_type": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document", "file_size": 197019, "creation_date": "2025-08-15", "last_modified_date": "2025-08-15"}, "hash": "5e779dd6126d42e4ef9a0a561a944fea9f8881955eb6120e25fce7e58627c3c8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "4": {"node_id": "e36cd957-8168-4da0-95bd-9c192e19db0d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_name": "\uff2a\uff23\uff21\uff29\uff13\uff10\uff12\uff2d\uff2b\u69cb\u9020_eng.docx", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Admin\\Desktop\\Advanced-RAG\\MergingCode\\data\\\uff2a\uff23\uff21\uff29\uff13\uff10\uff12\uff2d\uff2b\u69cb\u9020_eng.docx", "file_type": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document", "file_size": 197019, "creation_date": "2025-08-15", "last_modified_date": "2025-08-15"}, "hash": "2a8855510ab2c3d07738e7ca9d2dafeca28e5d5ba95fe356c5bb1acc8dab4ea3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "5": [{"node_id": "ce766899-ca25-429e-ab8a-7b9bf48f70e6", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_name": "\uff2a\uff23\uff21\uff29\uff13\uff10\uff12\uff2d\uff2b\u69cb\u9020_eng.docx", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Admin\\Desktop\\Advanced-RAG\\MergingCode\\data\\\uff2a\uff23\uff21\uff29\uff13\uff10\uff12\uff2d\uff2b\u69cb\u9020_eng.docx", "file_type": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document", "file_size": 197019, "creation_date": "2025-08-15", "last_modified_date": "2025-08-15"}, "hash": "f7ba91946ccf2e8693653cc736b672a4f568f68d7a8357627542acd210303e2b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}]}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Branding is about \"how it makes the customer feel.\" The manager of Walt Disney Attractions said, \"What we sell is happiness.\"\n\n\n\nRevlon CEO Charles Revson said:\n\n\"We make cosmetics in our factories\" and \"we sell hope in our stores.\"\n\n\n\nSwatch made watches easy fashion.\n\nThe Central Market owner\n\n\"It's not about the selection, it's about the shopping experience.\"\n\nCoca-Cola has successfully revived its traditional flavor as \"Classic.\"\n\n\n\nSeven's brand \"Seven Premium\" and Aeon's brand \"Top Value\".\n\nThe meaning is uncertain.\n\nLarge companies can do it, but small and medium-sized companies can't.

21, 2025).\n\n\"NTT Docomo's President Nakamura called former Shiseido Chairman Moto Uotani, saying that our company is not customer-oriented and that he wanted us to guide the company to become more customer-oriented. And so began the 1,000-day challenge to become more customer-oriented. The company must change to become more customer-oriented. Marketing is management itself! We have begun management reforms to establish customer-oriented management.\"\n\n\n\nDelighting customers, building trust, and growing them into lifelong customers. Customer-first philosophy.\n\nDoes customer first make a company grow?\n\nWhat does customer first mean?\n\nSince this does not exist in Japan, we will learn from the US example.\n\nTo become the number one customer-oriented company in Japan.\n\n\n\nNo matter what anyone says, Nordstrom is the number one company\n\nHe has a legendary reputation for his customer service.\n\nNordstrom Department Stores currently operates over 100 stores across the United States.\n\n1901. In the 1980s, it expanded to include clothing and other products. It grew into a department store. Nordstrom was founded by Nordstrom, a Swedish immigrant who opened a shoe store.\n\nIn his book \"When Service Becomes Legend,\"\n\nIt said that their motto is \"not to outmart (outsmart others with strategies), but to provide outservice (service that goes beyond service).\"\n\n\u3000\n\nThe president's welcoming speech to new employees reads as follows:\n\n\"Welcome to Nordstrom.\" It's a pleasure to have you here. At Nordstrom, our number one goal is to provide the best possible service to our customers. We expect you to aim high, both personally and professionally. You can achieve high goals. At our company, you make decisions all the time. Use your excellent judgment. Other than that, there are no rules at Nordstrom. When in doubt, don't be afraid to ask your manager, anytime, anywhere.\"\n\nEmployee training is only one day long, and there is no work manual.\n\nNordstrom introduced the \"inverted pyramid\" organization in 1971. Up until then, there had been no organizational charts. The inverted pyramid organization has customers at the top, salespeople below them, department managers, store managers, product managers, and buyers. At the very bottom is the president and board of directors.\n\n\n\nThere are only two types of jobs: the front line, which serves customers directly, and a set of jobs that serve front-line employees.\n\nThe president does not reign at the top of the organizational pyramid. The sales staff who interact with customers make their own judgments and decisions and respond to customers accordingly.\n\n\n\nI heard the following stories directly from sales staff and store service managers:\n\n\n\nI realized I had left my airline ticket on the counter. I told my colleague, \"Please help me at the counter!\" and drove to the airport in my car to deliver the ticket to the customer. I delivered it safely.\n\n\n\nA customer came in to return a tire. \"How much did you pay for it?\" Customer: \"$65.\"\n\nThe salesperson took $65 from the register and refunded it, even though I didn't have a purchase receipt or anything.\n\nThey didn't ask for it. The customer is right. Nordstrom doesn't sell tires.\n\n\n\nAn elderly man told a salesman he couldn't find his car (large parking lot in the US).\n\nThe salesperson immediately contacted the customer manager. The manager then asked someone who was available to help and searched the parking lot until they found the item. Later, the grandfather sent a thick thank-you letter in the mail. In it, he wrote, \"I've never bought from Nordstrom before, but I'll buy from Nordstrom from now on.\" The service manager said it was the happiest thing that had ever happened to him.\n\n\n\nThe Nordstrom manager, who I met for lunch at a lecture at Seibu Department Store, asked if the tire refund was true.\n\n\"It's true,\" was the answer. \"You'll lose money!\" was the question. \"You also give lectures and talk about tires. People all over the world will spread the word. How much is that worth?\" was the reply.\n\nI learned about this value. Apparently, many people hear about Nordstrom and visit the store to \"try it out.\" It's a difficult time to acquire new customers. This case explains why word of mouth is the most powerful tool for acquiring new customers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMitchell, a men's clothing specialty store with only three stores Customer First\n\nJack Mitchell's Customer-Focused Management\n\n\"My Ultimate Service: How 94% of Customers Say They're Satisfied\" by Jack Mitchell .\n\nIn 1958, my father opened the store that would become Mitchell's, a two-store men's clothing specialty store.\n\nThe customer database contains 115,000 customers. Customer lists and purchase data from both stores are stored in the database. The president and all executives are on the sales floor. It's a customer-oriented business. Naturally. They treat customers as if they were inviting them to their homes.\n\n\n\nPresident Mitchell's morning.\n\nLook at detailed data on customers who purchased over $2,000 the previous day. While sipping the first cup of coffee, find out the customer's name, the name of the staff member who served them, and the brand of the product that sold. While sipping the second cup of coffee, compare this month's sales with last year's. Afterwards, make a thank-you call and send a thank-you letter. Customer first is a natural obligation. Actions to retain customers.\n\n\n\nMitchell's winning strategy\n\nAlways maintain the highest level\n\nMaintaining industry-leading margins\n\nDon't make expenditures that don't impact customers\n\nEnd of season, zero inventory\n\nEven if the store is closed, someone always answers the phone when a customer calls. If the president isn't there, it's number two. If number two isn't there, the call goes to number three. The person who receives the call rushes to the store, opens the shutters, and waits for the customer. This is unthinkable behavior. They're taking unthinkable actions.\n\n\n\nA client spills coffee in the car on the way to a friend's wedding. There's nothing you can do.\n\nHe calls Mitchell, saying he knows they can do something about it. He opens the shutters and waits, even though it's his day off. He calls the suit seamstress. He can't wear a formal suit with coffee spilled on it. He measures the customer. He selects a suit from the suits in stock that is close to the measurements. The seamstress rushes to make it. The customer says it arrived in time for the wedding.

Delays in departure and arrival in the US are common. Customers must be patient and persevere.\n\nNo reserved seats. Sit wherever you like. Low fares.\n\nThere is no in-flight meal , and only one aircraft model is available (limited maintenance and inspections are required for this model, allowing for inspections to be completed in a short period of time).\n\nThey state that employees come first and customers second.\n\nHe spends more time planning company parties than drafting business policies. He creates advertisements that make fun of his company, employees, and acquaintances.\n\nCEO Harp Carey has employees appear at interviews in jackets and Bermuda shorts. This is truly \"outrageous.\" Boeing 737 aircraft painted in various colors.\n\nFlight attendants in mini dresses, flight attendants who surprise passengers by popping their heads out of the overhead bins, and female employees who show up in full military gear... We have created a corporate environment where people can freely express their ideas.\n\n\n\nSafety is not the focus of work. Enjoyment is the focus.

On Valentine's Day, the company presents the \"Heart Hero Award\" to employees who make outstanding contributions behind the scenes. The award ceremony is held in a large-scale event in the main lobby of the company's headquarters. The company has achieved excellent results by putting into practice ideas not discussed in business management or marketing theory.\n\n\n\n\n\nScandinavian Airlines CEO Jan Carlsson: \" Moment of Truth\"\n\nof Truth Of Truth\n\nFrontline employees are told that the 15 seconds of customer service they receive can determine the success of a company.\n\nThe moment of truth is 15 seconds. You have 15 seconds to finish the customer off.\n\nThe Moment of Truth is the final blow. The moment of truth. It's a term used in bullfighting.\n\nto make a good or bad impression on a customer .\n\nIt only takes a split second to decide whether to turn a customer into a lifelong enemy or a friend. A customer has less than 15 seconds to judge a company.\n\nThe coffee cup that was served was a little dirty\n\nThe hand towels smell\n\nThe table is wet\n\nThe soup is cold\n\nThe menu is dirty\n\nThe waiter takes a long time to come\n\nCooking is slow\n\nThe account is wrong\n\nThe uniform is dirty\n\nThe staff is yelling loudly\n\n\n\nAt age 36, Carlsson was the youngest airline president in the world, and was invited to lead the Swedish domestic airline Lynfriet, where he led the company's restructuring.\n\nDue to his achievements, he was appointed president of Scandinavian Airlines.\n\nThe company, which had a $30 million deficit the previous year, turned a profit in just one year.\n\nReallocating authority to employees.\n\nWe transformed the company into one that makes on-the-spot decisions for our customers.\n\nThey don't say you can't board without a ticket.

Service, Practice and Management\n\nWill the service improve business figures?\n\nThe answer is YES\n\nCompanies with high quality service have an operating profit margin of 12%.\n\nCompanies with poor service quality have operating profit margins of 1-3%.\n\nImproving the quality of service will increase profits.\n\n\"Service Management\" by Carl Albrecht and Ron Zemke states that successful service companies have eight distinctive factors.\n\n\n\nEmphasis on action: \"Just do it\" - Close contact with customers, customer first.\n\nAutonomy and entrepreneurship, productivity through people, empowering and taking action\n\nValue-based practices and management that communicates the vision to everyone\n\nDo the best you can without straying from the basics, and always strive for improvement\n\nSimple organization, small headquarters, well-organized organizational structure\n\nIt has both strict and gentle aspects at the same time.\n\nThorough responsibility and explanation for the line\n\nCorporate management that emphasizes technology and product development\n\n\n\nWe will become a strong company by providing services that are different from what we currently do.\n\nDo it now, do it anyway, stay close to customers, have a small headquarters, and show everyone your vision.\n\n\n\nResale of the first edition of \"The Service Management Revolution.\"\n\nIs what customers want from companies to keep bringing new products to market?\n\nIs this a new product that will change things?\n\nIs it the low price?\n\nDo customers just want low prices?\n\nCustomers want you to deliver on your promises, be precise, be respectful, understand the rush, and be well prepared.\n\n\n\n\n\nKarl Albrest's \"10 Lessons of Eternal Truth\"\n\nKnow your customers!\n\nDecide on a clear battlefield!\n\nStatistical methods that cannot be performed on a calculator are useless in practice.\n\nSmile training is a waste of time and money!\n\nChanging to a customer-centric approach is like teaching an elephant to dance\n\n\n\nIn his book Service Management, Karl Albrecht states that transforming into a service-practicing company is difficult.\n\nHe states that there are eternal truths about customer interactions with companies.\n\n\n\nThe 10 eternal truths are:\n\n1. Customers want value, not \"customer service\"\n\n2. Don't judge small differences\n\n3. Don't deceive your customers\n\n4. Large-scale programs like campaigns fail\n\n5. Customer focus will never happen unless leaders want it to happen.\n\n6. What employees feel, customers feel too\n\n7. Spirit cannot be preserved\n\n8. The manufacturing model won't work\n\n9.

About HOW\u3000\n\nMarketing System It consists of six boxes\n\n\n\nAuthor Krusti L. Nordheim.\n\nHe attended various marketing courses, read Kotler's \"Principles of Marketing,\" and studied various marketing books, but the theories were all scattered, and he was completely unable to understand what marketing was. There was no system for marketing. Although there were theoretical books on the steps to implementing marketing, there were no books that could serve as practical references.\n\n\n\nNordheim wrote at the beginning of this book that his research led him to the six big pictures he will now describe.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe six boxes are as shown in the figure.\n\nFirst, business goals: this year's sales target, profit target, operating profit margin\n\nSecond, marketing goals: number of new customers acquired, retention rate of existing customers, lifetime value per customer (=CLV)\n\nThird, source of volume: capturing market share\n\nFourth: STP; segmentation, targeting target customers, customer appeal positioning. Three initial letters of STP.\n\n5. Execution: Manufacturing and selling food, clothing, and shelter products, purchasing and selling food, clothing, and shelter products, and providing leisure and other services\n\n6. Evaluation: Did you achieve your goal of acquiring new customers? Did you achieve a 100% customer retention rate?\n\nHas the lifetime value per customer increased?\n\nFor all customer promotions implemented, was the return on investment (ROI) for the promotional investment amount 35% or more (said to be the pass mark)?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne is a box called Business Goals\n\n\n\nIdentify our areas of expertise, the most profitable product lineups, and categories. For example, what products are customers happy to buy? Which departments are our best buyers in charge of?\n\nDecide on your sales strategy. Will you appeal to low prices? EDLP? Or a wide range of value-added products?\n\nMake the most possible sales your business goal.\n\nMarketing is demand creation = customer creation. In retail store sales (real stores)\n\nDemand = Number of customers x CLV (lifetime value per customer) x Number of stores\n\nFor non-store sales (online sales)\n\nDemand = Number of small customers x CLV (lifetime value per customer)\n\n\n\nLifetime value per customer, not just the purchase amount per customer.\n\nOperating profit is the amount obtained by subtracting total sales expenses (cost of goods + promotional expenses) from the sales amount for the year.\n\nThis is called Net Profit Value (NPV). NPV divided by the number of customers\n\nThe number is the lifetime value per customer, or CLV.\n\nStore sales case: Sales = Number of customers x CLV x Number of stores\n\n1 million yen = 100 people x 10,000 yen x 1 store\n\n1 million yen = 200 people x 10,000 yen x 1 store\n\n1 million yen = 100 people x 20,000 yen x 1 store\n\n1 million yen = 100 people x 10,000 yen x 2 stores\n\n1 million yen = 200 people x 20,000 yen x 2 stores\n\n\n\nBusinesses must decide which strategy to use to achieve their goals: increasing customer numbers, increasing CLV per customer, or increasing the number of stores. Do they need to achieve all three? It's difficult. Focus on one.\n\nFirst, one.\n\n\n\nNumber of customers = Number of new customers acquired + Number of existing customers - Number of customers who have defected\n\n\n\nIf you want to increase the number of customers, should you acquire new customers or eliminate customer defections?\n\nIf you think it will be difficult to increase customer numbers, your marketing strategy should be to increase CLV by 5% from the previous year.\n\nIf you have the financial means, opening new stores or making acquisitions are growth strategies. So which one should you choose?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsecond box is called Marketing Objectives.\n\nMarketing goals. Let's think about what our marketing goals are. What kind of customers should we target? Young, middle-aged, mature (= middle-aged).\n\nWhat is the average number of customers per store?\n\nWhat is the goal for how many new customers to acquire each year? Keep the customer churn rate at 5%. If the churn rate is 5%, CLV will decrease if that number of new customers are not acquired. Marketing goals include the number of new customers to acquire and a 95% retention rate for existing customers.\n\nThe marketing goal is to increase CLV figures by 5% from the previous year.\n\n\n\nThe number of customers is: Number of customers = Number of new customers + Number of existing customers - Number of defecting customers", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4519, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "859f299d-e22b-4cb8-ac0c-acbcf1f90dee": {"__data__": {"id_": "859f299d-e22b-4cb8-ac0c-acbcf1f90dee", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"categories": ["Branding & Positioning", "Customer Segmentation", "Customer Value Analysis", "Marketing Execution", "Marketing Evaluation", "Performance Measurement"], "keywords": ["Customer Lifetime Value", "Market Segmentation", "Targeting", "Positioning", "Marketing Execution", "Marketing Evaluation"]}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "505b2418-d6c0-49f9-8883-249f5ea0f8e3", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_name": "\uff2a\uff23\uff21\uff29\uff13\uff10\uff12\uff2d\uff2b\u69cb\u9020_eng.docx", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Admin\\Desktop\\Advanced-RAG\\MergingCode\\data\\\uff2a\uff23\uff21\uff29\uff13\uff10\uff12\uff2d\uff2b\u69cb\u9020_eng.docx", "file_type": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document", "file_size": 197019, "creation_date": "2025-08-15", "last_modified_date": "2025-08-15"}, "hash": "884e110f65af94908bce267b6fe0496b51cb442c0543e5b3e59b58348c44f49b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "5c328f9a-e084-4c8d-9785-f4643f67dff0", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_name": "\uff2a\uff23\uff21\uff29\uff13\uff10\uff12\uff2d\uff2b\u69cb\u9020_eng.docx", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Admin\\Desktop\\Advanced-RAG\\MergingCode\\data\\\uff2a\uff23\uff21\uff29\uff13\uff10\uff12\uff2d\uff2b\u69cb\u9020_eng.docx", "file_type": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document", "file_size": 197019, "creation_date": "2025-08-15", "last_modified_date": "2025-08-15"}, "hash": "6e38b649bbea32457e241b404dbc0a6a8d89371c4d3c00dd7a2865466e658b67", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "4": {"node_id": "35857c9f-9f65-4663-a65c-7cdecd534ea4", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_name": "\uff2a\uff23\uff21\uff29\uff13\uff10\uff12\uff2d\uff2b\u69cb\u9020_eng.docx", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Admin\\Desktop\\Advanced-RAG\\MergingCode\\data\\\uff2a\uff23\uff21\uff29\uff13\uff10\uff12\uff2d\uff2b\u69cb\u9020_eng.docx", "file_type": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document", "file_size": 197019, "creation_date": "2025-08-15", "last_modified_date": "2025-08-15"}, "hash": "7d10ad913d694fdd6496940c98048945865999c61abe04be1be9ed8d54d46b3e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "The number of customers is: Number of customers = Number of new customers + Number of existing customers - Number of defecting customers\n\n\n\nAcquire 10% of the number of new customers from the previous year. \tThis is a difficult challenge in this day and age.\n\nAchieving a 100% retention rate for existing customers \t\tis also difficult.

Set segments with a high number of customers and their composition ratio, as well as segments with a high purchase amount and their composition ratio as your main targets.\n\n\n\nRather than relying on intuition, you should refer to the results of customer demand over the past year or so, and specifically and objectively determine which demand opportunities to target. This is how marketing is implemented.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4 STP boxes 3 small boxes\n\nNo. 3: Positioning\u3000\n\n\n\nCompetitor companies sell similar products in similar shelf layouts and with similar sales floor layouts.\n\nWe segmented customers and regions and considered opportunities for each segment.\n\nThis is not enough. We are selling the same products in the same way as our competitors, and using the same sales promotion methods. We have segmented, targeted, and decided to target segments that offer the greatest opportunity for investment in sales promotion funds. This is not enough.\n\n\n\nThere is an easy-to-understand example.\n\nPositioning done by American Dial Soap.\n\n\"Skin-beautifying effect\" for women. \"Body odor prevention\" for men.

remaining 50% at 35% above cost, etc. This is the kind of pricing policy we will implement.\n\nAnother thing to consider when setting prices is by item (natto, tofu, yogurt, etc.).\n\nPrices are

Department stores include Louis Vuitton, Hermes, shoe departments, bag departments, Kana Shojuan, Bunmeido, and Juchheim.\n\n\n\nBy department, and then by subdivision of the department (designating the department, then the subdivision).\n\nIn department stores, there are shoe sections, bag sections, sections by shop, such as Kana Shojuan, Bunmeido, and Hermes.\n\n\n\nBy specifying the period from January to December last year and this year, or from January to June or the first half or second half of July to December, the number of new customers acquired, the number of customers who have defected, and the total number of customers who have made purchases this year (= number of existing customers) can be displayed for each sales area in just three minutes.\n\n\n\nIf the number of new customers acquired is low, such as zero customer defections, then the sales floor or shop has very high customer satisfaction.\n\nIf the opposite were true, it could be evaluated as a sales area where customers are dissatisfied.\n\n\n\nOnce a year, the number of new customers acquired, the number of defected customers, and customers who have spent over 1 million yen on all sales floors are displayed on a single screen, along with customer rankings by purchase amount.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is also a way to target people based on their life stage.\n\nOne of the segmentations: life stage", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3898, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "06943454-b62f-4806-abf9-fe2b73fcf4a5": {"__data__": {"id_": "06943454-b62f-4806-abf9-fe2b73fcf4a5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"categories": ["Branding & Positioning", "Customer Segmentation", "Customer Value Analysis", "Marketing Execution", "Marketing Evaluation", "Performance Measurement"], "keywords": ["Customer Lifetime Value", "Market Segmentation", "Targeting", "Positioning", "Marketing Execution", "Marketing Evaluation"]}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "505b2418-d6c0-49f9-8883-249f5ea0f8e3", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_name": "\uff2a\uff23\uff21\uff29\uff13\uff10\uff12\uff2d\uff2b\u69cb\u9020_eng.docx", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Admin\\Desktop\\Advanced-RAG\\MergingCode\\data\\\uff2a\uff23\uff21\uff29\uff13\uff10\uff12\uff2d\uff2b\u69cb\u9020_eng.docx", "file_type": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document", "file_size": 197019, "creation_date": "2025-08-15", "last_modified_date": "2025-08-15"}, "hash": "884e110f65af94908bce267b6fe0496b51cb442c0543e5b3e59b58348c44f49b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "32b41b6c-5ce6-4884-aadf-389a6dfe4105", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_name": "\uff2a\uff23\uff21\uff29\uff13\uff10\uff12\uff2d\uff2b\u69cb\u9020_eng.docx", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Admin\\Desktop\\Advanced-RAG\\MergingCode\\data\\\uff2a\uff23\uff21\uff29\uff13\uff10\uff12\uff2d\uff2b\u69cb\u9020_eng.docx", "file_type": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document", "file_size": 197019, "creation_date": "2025-08-15", "last_modified_date": "2025-08-15"}, "hash": "3e74151bf57449db4835813a3942a7cd94a64ff353004e4d840e37714de94493", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "4": {"node_id": "acb9cdbc-dd31-4607-bed3-df743c48ed6a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_name": "\uff2a\uff23\uff21\uff29\uff13\uff10\uff12\uff2d\uff2b\u69cb\u9020_eng.docx", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Admin\\Desktop\\Advanced-RAG\\MergingCode\\data\\\uff2a\uff23\uff21\uff29\uff13\uff10\uff12\uff2d\uff2b\u69cb\u9020_eng.docx", "file_type": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document", "file_size": 197019, "creation_date": "2025-08-15", "last_modified_date": "2025-08-15"}, "hash": "5e779dd6126d42e4ef9a0a561a944fea9f8881955eb6120e25fce7e58627c3c8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Once a year, the number of new customers acquired, the number of defected customers, and customers who have spent over 1 million yen on all sales floors are displayed on a single screen, along with customer rankings by purchase amount.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is also a way to target people based on their life stage.\n\nOne of the segmentations: life stage\n\n\n\nLife Stage Segmentation Part 1\n\nLife, from the cradle to the grave. As we grow, we experience different stages.\n\nBaby stage. Toddler stage, elementary school, junior high school, high school, and university learning stages.\n\nThe single stage, the life stage of a newly married couple (newlyweds), the stage of raising children, the stage of family growth with the birth of a second child, the stage of children moving out, and the stage of old age. Everyone experiences the life cycle of life.\n\nDepending on the stage you are in, your emotions, desires, needs, and wants will be different.\n\nIn his book \"Career Couples,\" which describes the roles of men and women in the new era, he describes life stages as follows:\n\nThe couple stage (starting at marriage and up to the birth of the first child), the expansion stage (from the birth of the first child to the birth of the second child), the peak stage (when there are two or more preschool-aged children), the full house stage (until the first child leaves home), the contraction stage (ending when the last child moves out), and the empty family stage (when all the children have left).\n\n\n\n\n\nLife Stage Segmentation Part 2\n\nSegmentation by generation, also known as generational marketing.\n\nA marketing method that treats generations as a single group.\n\nBaby Boomers, second generation baby boomers, Generation Z, Millennials, etc.\n\nBaby boomer Taichi Sakaiya published a book titled \"The Baby Boomer Generation,\" which became a huge bestseller.\n\n\n\nGeneration Z refers to those born between the late 1990s and early 2010s. As of 2025, they are between the ages of 13 and 29.\n\nThey are also known as digital natives, who grew up in an environment where the internet and smartphones were widespread from an early age, and social natives who are adept at using social media.\n\nA generation that flocks to the city's downtown areas .\n\n\n\nMillennials are people born between the 1980s and mid-1990s, experienced the spread of digital technology, and are adept at using social media. As of 2025, they will be between 35 and 45 years old. They are the generation that primarily raises children. Many women are unmarried, and many are working. They are the main consumers. Known as the \"king of singers, \" Lady Gaga (born March 28, 1986) is an American singer-songwriter, music producer, actress, businesswoman, and philanthropist, and is said to be a representative of the millennial generation.\n\n\n\nLife Stage Segmentation Part 3\n\nAll developed countries are simultaneously entering an aging society, and are said to be living in an aging society with a declining birthrate.\n\nJapan is at the forefront, followed by China, South Korea, North Korea, etc. Countries with large immigrant populations, Asia, Africa, and India are developing countries. Japan's major retailers are competing to enter Asian countries and India in search of growth.\n\n\n\nThe largest population in Japan is 36.96 million people aged 65 or over. The values of this elderly generation are said to be as follows:\n\nYoung people simply focused on price when making their purchases, but older people value value over price.\n\nBased on past purchase experiences, they feel dissatisfied or lacking in bargain items. They place importance on value.\n\nDuring your working life, you have three places: work, family, and friends. When you retire, you lose your workplace. You make up for it with the two remaining circles. You tend to prefer social circles.\n\nThey like independence. They stick to their own ideas. They make their own decisions. They are not easily influenced by the opinions of others. They have a desire to live independently, both mentally and physically, without relying on others.\n\n\n\nIt's a common misconception that retirement causes the brain of an older person to hibernate until death.\n\nThis is far from the truth. Mature people have time for themselves. They can expand their horizons in new ways, big and small. They have renewed energy and an eye for expanding their knowledge. They have a desire to learn and expand their horizons.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 3552, "end_char_idx": 7963, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "40f90872-e111-4b78-8128-1001439678db": {"__data__": {"id_": "40f90872-e111-4b78-8128-1001439678db", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"categories": ["Branding & Positioning", "Customer Segmentation", "Customer Value Analysis", "Marketing Execution", "Marketing Evaluation", "Performance Measurement"], "keywords": ["Customer Lifetime Value", "Market Segmentation", "Targeting", "Positioning", "Marketing Execution", "Marketing Evaluation"]}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "505b2418-d6c0-49f9-8883-249f5ea0f8e3", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_name": "\uff2a\uff23\uff21\uff29\uff13\uff10\uff12\uff2d\uff2b\u69cb\u9020_eng.docx", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Admin\\Desktop\\Advanced-RAG\\MergingCode\\data\\\uff2a\uff23\uff21\uff29\uff13\uff10\uff12\uff2d\uff2b\u69cb\u9020_eng.docx", "file_type": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document", "file_size": 197019, "creation_date": "2025-08-15", "last_modified_date": "2025-08-15"}, "hash": "884e110f65af94908bce267b6fe0496b51cb442c0543e5b3e59b58348c44f49b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "06943454-b62f-4806-abf9-fe2b73fcf4a5", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_name": "\uff2a\uff23\uff21\uff29\uff13\uff10\uff12\uff2d\uff2b\u69cb\u9020_eng.docx", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Admin\\Desktop\\Advanced-RAG\\MergingCode\\data\\\uff2a\uff23\uff21\uff29\uff13\uff10\uff12\uff2d\uff2b\u69cb\u9020_eng.docx", "file_type": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document", "file_size": 197019, "creation_date": "2025-08-15", "last_modified_date": "2025-08-15"}, "hash": "80c7c270493fc66e2df9bee5e846891fd26934040566f19323d4249556ccf2e9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "4": {"node_id": "acb9cdbc-dd31-4607-bed3-df743c48ed6a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_name": "\uff2a\uff23\uff21\uff29\uff13\uff10\uff12\uff2d\uff2b\u69cb\u9020_eng.docx", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Admin\\Desktop\\Advanced-RAG\\MergingCode\\data\\\uff2a\uff23\uff21\uff29\uff13\uff10\uff12\uff2d\uff2b\u69cb\u9020_eng.docx", "file_type": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document", "file_size": 197019, "creation_date": "2025-08-15", "last_modified_date": "2025-08-15"}, "hash": "5e779dd6126d42e4ef9a0a561a944fea9f8881955eb6120e25fce7e58627c3c8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "It's a common misconception that retirement causes the brain of an older person to hibernate until death.\n\nThis is far from the truth.

The distribution industry needs to develop marketing that targets more middle-aged people (i.e., mature people). There is little knowledge about the psychology and strengths of the elderly.\n\n\n\nLife Stage Segmentation Part 4\n\nIntergenerational values are called cohorts.\n\nA cohort is a group of people who grew up in the same era and were influenced by the same external events that shaped their lives as they grew older.\n\nThe US middle-aged cohort is defined as follows:\n\nA group born before the mid-1920s who grew up in the midst of the Great Depression.\n\nThis generation was born in the late 1920s and early 1930s and was less affected by the Great Depression during their youth, but was heavily affected by World War II.\n\nThe generation born during peacetime from the late 1930s to 1946 is known as the Silent Generation.\n\nThe youngest generation are baby boomers, born after 1946.\n\nThey were an unprecedented generation in American history who were influenced by hippie culture around the time of the Vietnam War (1950s).\n\nThe older generation, who lived through the Great Depression, sees debt as almost a crime.\n\n65 have no debt, including paid-off mortgages.\n\nBaby boomers, the youngest generation, rely on credit as a financial tool. They spend a lot on repayment (payment on credit), making them a valuable consumer for retailers like Walmart.\n\n\n\nLife Stage Conclusions;\n\nConsider the department you are in charge of and which stage you want to target.\n\nBuyers, what product are you currently purchasing? What stage is it for?\n\nSales representative: What stage is the product you just picked up aimed at?\n\nWhen selling something, you have to be conscious of your customers. Who you are selling to, who you want to buy,\n\nIf you purchase, display, and sell products without this in mind, you will not be able to attract many customers.\n\nBe strongly aware of segmentation, targeting, positioning, and STP.\n\n\n\nThere is also a way to target people based on their lifestyle .\n\nOne of the segmentations: Lifestyle\n\n\n\nIn order to satisfy customer needs, marketing that focuses on the customer's lifestyle is a marketing method that allows you to get closer to customers than just their life stage.\n\nconsumers from a psychological perspective.\n\nSociologist D.G. Moore defines lifestyle as \"a patterned way of living.\" Psychologist G.W. Allport defines it as \"a view of life and values that are gradually formed in the course of life .\" Customers are human beings with emotions. Different people feel differently.\n\n\n\nThe lifestyles of the pre-war and post-war generations\n\nFrugality is the motto, hard work and savings. Sacrificing today for tomorrow's happiness. Emphasizing human bonds. Living peacefully with family and the community. A world of \"we.\" Currently, a world of \"I am me.\" Putting others on the back burner. It's even worse than that. Indifferent to others. It's okay as long as you're having fun. Not interested in the person living next door. Don't say hello.\n\nAt home, locked in my room, staring at my smartphone. While walking down the street, riding my bike. Is there urgent news? A friend sitting next to me. We're talking on our smartphones. It's not really a discussion. The family is falling apart. The daughter and son are mentally independent. A lifestyle where money is the purpose of life. The elderly are seen as a social scourge. The internet society is creating complex lifestyles. Nearly 100% of food purchases are made at convenience stores.\n\nA young person died from some reason. A certain monk said, \"It doesn't decay easily.\" That's right, there are a lot of preservatives in the body.

The sales floors are divided into categories based on what people want to buy. Ferragamo, Chanel, Christian Dior, Louis Vuitton, Coach, Clinic, Ralph Lauren, Kenzo, Sanrio, Miki House, Kana Shojuan, Bunmeido, Minamoto Kitchoan, Juchheim, Godiva, Morozoff, etc. The sales floor itself reflects customer needs.\n\n\n\nHome centers stock products related to professional construction, kids' hobbies, gardening, outdoor leisure, pet life, DIY, cycling, interior design, farming, kitchens, bathrooms and toilets, home appliances, organization, and more.\n\nCustomers who buy drills and saws are registered with the \"Construction Pro\" lifestyle.\n\nCustomers who buy things like flower seeds and lawnmowers are considered to have a \"gardening\" lifestyle.\n\n\n\nAt a drugstore, customers who buy energy drinks are considered \"energy drinkers , \" customers who buy anti-aging supplements are considered \"anti-aging\" lifestyle, and customers who buy diet-related products are considered \"diet\" lifestyle.\n\n\n\nAs for supermarkets, let us introduce the lifestyle initiatives undertaken by their headquarters in London, UK.\n\n\"Convenience Store,\" \"Cooking,\" \"Healthy,\" \"Big Box,\" \"Small Foods,\" \"Green\"\n\nIt defined around 30 lifestyles, including \" fruit,\" \"low price,\" \"private brand,\" \"value foods,\" \"traditional,\" \"latch box,\" \"ethnic,\" \"high price,\" \"meat,\" and \"vegetarian.\"\n\n\n\nis assigned 30 lifestyle codes such as \"This is meat,\" \"This product is a high-end accessory,\" or \"This product is a health food.\"\n\nThe receipt detail data will reveal the lifestyle code, and purchases with a high number of that code will correspond to the appropriate lifestyle.\n\n\n\nLifestyle Customer Identification, developed by Jericho Consulting, takes a different approach to identifying lifestyles.\n\nFor example, customers who buy more than 20 items from the prepared food section per month are classified as \"convenience type,\" while customers who buy Tomaru udon soup, miso, soy sauce, and olive oil are classified as \"kitchen type\" or \"cooking type.\"\n\nA lifestyle bar for registering such things is displayed on the screen.\n\n\n\nBy specifying a three-month period and clicking the \"Cooking\" bar, customers who have purchased over 100,000 yen worth of products such as Tomaru Udon soup and miso from the receipt data stored in the database will be classified as cooking lovers.\n\nThe number of customers is counted, and if there are 50, the bar displays 50. By displaying a list of 50 people, you can extract 50 customers as promotional targets.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStanford Research Institute (SRI) spent over 10 years\n\nAnalysis of purchasing data from thousands of Americans, categorization into nine lifestyle patterns", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 11918, "end_char_idx": 14880, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "63389b1c-bb21-4c90-9d4e-993a005e8b8c": {"__data__": {"id_": "63389b1c-bb21-4c90-9d4e-993a005e8b8c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"categories": ["Branding & Positioning", "Customer Segmentation", "Customer Value Analysis", "Marketing Execution", "Marketing Evaluation", "Performance Measurement"], "keywords": ["Customer Lifetime Value", "Market Segmentation", "Targeting", "Positioning", "Marketing Execution", "Marketing Evaluation"]}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "505b2418-d6c0-49f9-8883-249f5ea0f8e3", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_name": "\uff2a\uff23\uff21\uff29\uff13\uff10\uff12\uff2d\uff2b\u69cb\u9020_eng.docx", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Admin\\Desktop\\Advanced-RAG\\MergingCode\\data\\\uff2a\uff23\uff21\uff29\uff13\uff10\uff12\uff2d\uff2b\u69cb\u9020_eng.docx", "file_type": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document", "file_size": 197019, "creation_date": "2025-08-15", "last_modified_date": "2025-08-15"}, "hash": "884e110f65af94908bce267b6fe0496b51cb442c0543e5b3e59b58348c44f49b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "d9e937e1-37ec-41f6-b242-0b4aa8465ebc", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_name": "\uff2a\uff23\uff21\uff29\uff13\uff10\uff12\uff2d\uff2b\u69cb\u9020_eng.docx", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Admin\\Desktop\\Advanced-RAG\\MergingCode\\data\\\uff2a\uff23\uff21\uff29\uff13\uff10\uff12\uff2d\uff2b\u69cb\u9020_eng.docx", "file_type": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document", "file_size": 197019, "creation_date": "2025-08-15", "last_modified_date": "2025-08-15"}, "hash": "abc528fbf1eb8ec581a213f2b315ddec8578306668703f12bb51800636e65065", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "4": {"node_id": "acb9cdbc-dd31-4607-bed3-df743c48ed6a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_name": "\uff2a\uff23\uff21\uff29\uff13\uff10\uff12\uff2d\uff2b\u69cb\u9020_eng.docx", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Admin\\Desktop\\Advanced-RAG\\MergingCode\\data\\\uff2a\uff23\uff21\uff29\uff13\uff10\uff12\uff2d\uff2b\u69cb\u9020_eng.docx", "file_type": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document", "file_size": 197019, "creation_date": "2025-08-15", "last_modified_date": "2025-08-15"}, "hash": "5e779dd6126d42e4ef9a0a561a944fea9f8881955eb6120e25fce7e58627c3c8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Stanford Research Institute (SRI) spent over 10 years\n\nAnalysis of purchasing data from thousands of Americans, categorization into nine lifestyle patterns\n\n\n\nResearch has begun to prove Maslow's \"Five-stage pyramid of needs.\"\n\nMaslow explained the five levels of human needs in \"The Complete Man,\" published in 1964. The book became a hot topic around the world. The five levels begin with \"physiological needs,\" then move on to \"safety needs,\" and then to the even higher level of \"social conformity needs.\" Next comes \"ego needs,\" which are the desire to be recognized by others, and at the top of the pyramid is the need for self-actualization.\n\nThe Stanford Research Institute is a spade diagram, as shown in Figure.\n\nFrom the bottom up, Survivor, Sustainer, and Belonger.\n\nFrom there it splits into left and right.\n\nLeft: Emulator, Achiever.\n\nRight side: I Am Me, Experiential, Socially Conscious.\n\nThe top is integrated self-actualization.\n\nA group struggling to survive is called a survivor (to survive), a sustainer (to hang on) , and a conservative, traditional Belonger.\n\nEmulators are young people who strive to get ahead. Achievers are\n\nA middle-aged man who has been promoted to department manager and executive.\n\nOn the right are I Am Me. Achievers' children. Experimentalists are people seeking social experience, and Social Conscious are people with a high level of social awareness.\n\nMaintaining the global environment, curbing climate change, sustainability, SDGs.\n\nThe arrows in the diagram. Lifestyles move left and right, and up and down and left and right with social changes and changes in the times.\n\nWhat is particularly noteworthy is that compared to 50 years ago, the number of achievers (those with high salaries) has become extremely small and has shrunk. I Am Me is centered around many Z households.\n\nIt can be expected that the population below Belonger has increased significantly.\n\nMost of the 36.96 million people aged 65 or older are in this group. \"I am me\" is extremely individualistic. As long as I'm happy, other people don't matter.\n\nThe year is 2025, a time of rising prices, and the population is growing.The company is dealing with low-income people who are ``I am me'' (people who do not consume much material goods) and below the ``Belonger'' level.\n\nWe are now in an environment where marketing and CRM are becoming increasingly important.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAiming to attract customers through brand building\n\nAcquire new customers, maintain existing customer retention rates, and increase CLV\n\nBrand Thinking Use\n\n\n\nIf you have a brand, you can set your positioning.\n\nA brand is more than a product. It's something that is created in the minds of customers.\n\nWhen customers see a brand logo, they know what it is.\n\nNo explanation needed. Everyone knows it.\n\nFor example, when a housewife buys juice, a story emerges: \"Kids love it. It's good for your health!\"\n\n\n\nA brand communicates technology, quality, functional characteristics, benefits, and empathy to customers.\n\nA brand is a customer's \"memory aid,\" \"quality information,\" and \"basis for differentiation.\"\n\nA brand is something that motivates customers to buy.\n\n\n\nMercedes-Benz is prestigious. Sony is a pioneer. Kellogg is a familiar brand.\n\nKleenex is disposable. Harry Potter is a story. Nike is a sport.\n\nStarbucks is postmodern. Rolex is luxury. Tiffany is joy.\n\nDavid Beckham is an idol. Harley Davidson is a man. Guinness is overtime.\n\nAmazon is internet shopping. Domino's Pizza is home delivery.\n\n\n\nBrand Law\n\nA brand is powerful when it's focused. Create a word in the mind of your customers.\n\nThe easiest way to destroy a brand is to put it on every product.\n\nUse colors that are opposite to your competitors. Brands are names. Ultimately, a brand is a name.\n\nWhen deciding on a brand name, consider things like: is it easy to pronounce? Does it have a musical sound? Can you write it down after hearing it once? Is it easy to read? Does it speak clearly? Is it concise? Is it unique? Is it interesting? Does it feel authentic?\n\n\n\nBranding is about \"how it makes the customer feel.\" The manager of Walt Disney Attractions said, \"What we sell is happiness.\"", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 14725, "end_char_idx": 18892, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ce766899-ca25-429e-ab8a-7b9bf48f70e6": {"__data__": {"id_": "ce766899-ca25-429e-ab8a-7b9bf48f70e6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"categories": ["Branding & Positioning", "Customer Segmentation", "Customer Value Analysis", "Marketing Execution", "Marketing Evaluation", "Performance Measurement"], "keywords": ["Customer Lifetime Value", "Market Segmentation", "Targeting", "Positioning", "Marketing Execution", "Marketing Evaluation"]}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "505b2418-d6c0-49f9-8883-249f5ea0f8e3", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_name": "\uff2a\uff23\uff21\uff29\uff13\uff10\uff12\uff2d\uff2b\u69cb\u9020_eng.docx", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Admin\\Desktop\\Advanced-RAG\\MergingCode\\data\\\uff2a\uff23\uff21\uff29\uff13\uff10\uff12\uff2d\uff2b\u69cb\u9020_eng.docx", "file_type": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document", "file_size": 197019, "creation_date": "2025-08-15", "last_modified_date": "2025-08-15"}, "hash": "884e110f65af94908bce267b6fe0496b51cb442c0543e5b3e59b58348c44f49b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "4": {"node_id": "00441128-d823-4872-9015-34db7dcb3154", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_name": "\uff2a\uff23\uff21\uff29\uff13\uff10\uff12\uff2d\uff2b\u69cb\u9020_eng.docx", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Admin\\Desktop\\Advanced-RAG\\MergingCode\\data\\\uff2a\uff23\uff21\uff29\uff13\uff10\uff12\uff2d\uff2b\u69cb\u9020_eng.docx", "file_type": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document", "file_size": 197019, "creation_date": "2025-08-15", "last_modified_date": "2025-08-15"}, "hash": "f7ba91946ccf2e8693653cc736b672a4f568f68d7a8357627542acd210303e2b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Branding is about \"how it makes the customer feel.\" The manager of Walt Disney Attractions said, \"What we sell is happiness.\"\n\n\n\nRevlon CEO Charles Revson said:\n\n\"We make cosmetics in our factories\" and \"we sell hope in our stores.\"\n\n\n\nSwatch made watches easy fashion.\n\nThe Central Market owner\n\n\"It's not about the selection, it's about the shopping experience.\"\n\nCoca-Cola has successfully revived its traditional flavor as \"Classic.\"\n\n\n\nSeven's brand \"Seven Premium\" and Aeon's brand \"Top Value\".\n\nThe meaning is uncertain.\n\nLarge companies can do it, but small and medium-sized companies can't.

Customer-first philosophy.\n\nDoes customer first make a company grow?\n\nWhat does customer first mean?\n\nSince this does not exist in Japan, we will learn from the US example.\n\nTo become the number one customer-oriented company in Japan.\n\n\n\nNo matter what anyone says, Nordstrom is the number one company\n\nHe has a legendary reputation for his customer service.\n\nNordstrom Department Stores currently operates over 100 stores across the United States.\n\n1901. In the 1980s, it expanded to include clothing and other products. It grew into a department store. Nordstrom was founded by Nordstrom, a Swedish immigrant who opened a shoe store.\n\nIn his book \"When Service Becomes Legend,\"\n\nIt said that their motto is \"not to outmart (outsmart others with strategies), but to provide outservice (service that goes beyond service).\"\n\n\u3000\n\nThe president's welcoming speech to new employees reads as follows:\n\n\"Welcome to Nordstrom.\" It's a pleasure to have you here. At Nordstrom, our number one goal is to provide the best possible service to our customers. We expect you to aim high, both personally and professionally. You can achieve high goals. At our company, you make decisions all the time. Use your excellent judgment. Other than that, there are no rules at Nordstrom. When in doubt, don't be afraid to ask your manager, anytime, anywhere.\"\n\nEmployee training is only one day long, and there is no work manual.\n\nNordstrom introduced the \"inverted pyramid\" organization in 1971. Up until then, there had been no organizational charts. The inverted pyramid organization has customers at the top, salespeople below them, department managers, store managers, product managers, and buyers. At the very bottom is the president and board of directors.\n\n\n\nThere are only two types of jobs: the front line, which serves customers directly, and a set of jobs that serve front-line employees.\n\nThe president does not reign at the top of the organizational pyramid. The sales staff who interact with customers make their own judgments and decisions and respond to customers accordingly.\n\n\n\nI heard the following stories directly from sales staff and store service managers:\n\n\n\nI realized I had left my airline ticket on the counter. I told my colleague, \"Please help me at the counter!\" and drove to the airport in my car to deliver the ticket to the customer. I delivered it safely.\n\n\n\nA customer came in to return a tire. \"How much did you pay for it?\" Customer: \"$65.\"\n\nThe salesperson took $65 from the register and refunded it, even though I didn't have a purchase receipt or anything.\n\nThey didn't ask for it. The customer is right. Nordstrom doesn't sell tires.\n\n\n\nAn elderly man told a salesman he couldn't find his car (large parking lot in the US).\n\nThe salesperson immediately contacted the customer manager. The manager then asked someone who was available to help and searched the parking lot until they found the item. Later, the grandfather sent a thick thank-you letter in the mail. In it, he wrote, \"I've never bought from Nordstrom before, but I'll buy from Nordstrom from now on.\" The service manager said it was the happiest thing that had ever happened to him.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4596, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "818ad9b1-5cb3-4ebe-9077-ff78e1518dca": {"__data__": {"id_": "818ad9b1-5cb3-4ebe-9077-ff78e1518dca", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"categories": ["Branding & Positioning", "Customer Segmentation", "Customer Value Analysis", "Marketing Execution", "Marketing Evaluation", "Performance Measurement"], "keywords": ["Customer Lifetime Value", "Market Segmentation", "Targeting", "Positioning", "Marketing Execution", "Marketing Evaluation"]}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "505b2418-d6c0-49f9-8883-249f5ea0f8e3", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_name": "\uff2a\uff23\uff21\uff29\uff13\uff10\uff12\uff2d\uff2b\u69cb\u9020_eng.docx", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Admin\\Desktop\\Advanced-RAG\\MergingCode\\data\\\uff2a\uff23\uff21\uff29\uff13\uff10\uff12\uff2d\uff2b\u69cb\u9020_eng.docx", "file_type": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document", "file_size": 197019, "creation_date": "2025-08-15", "last_modified_date": "2025-08-15"}, "hash": "884e110f65af94908bce267b6fe0496b51cb442c0543e5b3e59b58348c44f49b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "ac39ba81-b4cb-440b-9f63-7601b881046d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_name": "\uff2a\uff23\uff21\uff29\uff13\uff10\uff12\uff2d\uff2b\u69cb\u9020_eng.docx", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Admin\\Desktop\\Advanced-RAG\\MergingCode\\data\\\uff2a\uff23\uff21\uff29\uff13\uff10\uff12\uff2d\uff2b\u69cb\u9020_eng.docx", "file_type": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document", "file_size": 197019, "creation_date": "2025-08-15", "last_modified_date": "2025-08-15"}, "hash": "cb1200b17357b0ea7d96551ec965d53544d1842fe8f8c6638b72fbda13d69882", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "4": {"node_id": "39f5f718-a544-486f-b99e-7ae9deed5b11", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_name": "\uff2a\uff23\uff21\uff29\uff13\uff10\uff12\uff2d\uff2b\u69cb\u9020_eng.docx", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Admin\\Desktop\\Advanced-RAG\\MergingCode\\data\\\uff2a\uff23\uff21\uff29\uff13\uff10\uff12\uff2d\uff2b\u69cb\u9020_eng.docx", "file_type": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document", "file_size": 197019, "creation_date": "2025-08-15", "last_modified_date": "2025-08-15"}, "hash": "28736af3d649bf710794cfee0f43d1da9631bf6d0fa1a37b598535c36c148bff", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "The Nordstrom manager, who I met for lunch at a lecture at Seibu Department Store, asked if the tire refund was true.\n\n\"It's true,\" was the answer. \"You'll lose money!\" was the question. \"You also give lectures and talk about tires.

This case explains why word of mouth is the most powerful tool for acquiring new customers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMitchell, a men's clothing specialty store with only three stores Customer First\n\nJack Mitchell's Customer-Focused Management\n\n\"My Ultimate Service: How 94% of Customers Say They're Satisfied\" by Jack Mitchell .\n\nIn 1958, my father opened the store that would become Mitchell's, a two-store men's clothing specialty store.\n\nThe customer database contains 115,000 customers. Customer lists and purchase data from both stores are stored in the database. The president and all executives are on the sales floor. It's a customer-oriented business. Naturally. They treat customers as if they were inviting them to their homes.\n\n\n\nPresident Mitchell's morning.\n\nLook at detailed data on customers who purchased over $2,000 the previous day. While sipping the first cup of coffee, find out the customer's name, the name of the staff member who served them, and the brand of the product that sold. While sipping the second cup of coffee, compare this month's sales with last year's. Afterwards, make a thank-you call and send a thank-you letter. Customer first is a natural obligation. Actions to retain customers.\n\n\n\nMitchell's winning strategy\n\nAlways maintain the highest level\n\nMaintaining industry-leading margins\n\nDon't make expenditures that don't impact customers\n\nEnd of season, zero inventory\n\nEven if the store is closed, someone always answers the phone when a customer calls. If the president isn't there, it's number two. If number two isn't there, the call goes to number three. The person who receives the call rushes to the store, opens the shutters, and waits for the customer. This is unthinkable behavior. They're taking unthinkable actions.\n\n\n\nA client spills coffee in the car on the way to a friend's wedding. There's nothing you can do.\n\nHe calls Mitchell, saying he knows they can do something about it. He opens the shutters and waits, even though it's his day off. He calls the suit seamstress. He can't wear a formal suit with coffee spilled on it. He measures the customer. He selects a suit from the suits in stock that is close to the measurements. The seamstress rushes to make it. The customer says it arrived in time for the wedding. There are many stories like this in his book.\n\n\n\n\n\nSouthwest Airlines Customer First\n\nThis airline has grown rapidly using the following strategies and tactics:\n\nThis shows the company's management philosophy of concentration and its thorough commitment to service.\n\nFlights must be on time. Delays in departure and arrival in the US are common. Customers must be patient and persevere.\n\nNo reserved seats. Sit wherever you like. Low fares.\n\nThere is no in-flight meal , and only one aircraft model is available (limited maintenance and inspections are required for this model, allowing for inspections to be completed in a short period of time).\n\nThey state that employees come first and customers second.\n\nHe spends more time planning company parties than drafting business policies. He creates advertisements that make fun of his company, employees, and acquaintances.\n\nCEO Harp Carey has employees appear at interviews in jackets and Bermuda shorts. This is truly \"outrageous.\" Boeing 737 aircraft painted in various colors.\n\nFlight attendants in mini dresses, flight attendants who surprise passengers by popping their heads out of the overhead bins, and female employees who show up in full military gear... We have created a corporate environment where people can freely express their ideas.\n\n\n\nSafety is not the focus of work. Enjoyment is the focus. Employee-oriented printed materials such as company newsletters, pamphlets, and videos amount to 642 pages per employee per year.\n\nsends out 75,000 congratulatory cards to customers, employees, and friends for birthdays, wedding anniversaries, baby births, and other special occasions . On Valentine's Day, the company presents the \"Heart Hero Award\" to employees who make outstanding contributions behind the scenes. The award ceremony is held in a large-scale event in the main lobby of the company's headquarters. The company has achieved excellent results by putting into practice ideas not discussed in business management or marketing theory.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 4600, "end_char_idx": 9350, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1b0f28e3-dd19-480a-9050-fa2a51ca6b3a": {"__data__": {"id_": "1b0f28e3-dd19-480a-9050-fa2a51ca6b3a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"categories": ["Branding & Positioning", "Customer Segmentation", "Customer Value Analysis", "Marketing Execution", "Marketing Evaluation", "Performance Measurement"], "keywords": ["Customer Lifetime Value", "Market Segmentation", "Targeting", "Positioning", "Marketing Execution", "Marketing Evaluation"]}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "505b2418-d6c0-49f9-8883-249f5ea0f8e3", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_name": "\uff2a\uff23\uff21\uff29\uff13\uff10\uff12\uff2d\uff2b\u69cb\u9020_eng.docx", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Admin\\Desktop\\Advanced-RAG\\MergingCode\\data\\\uff2a\uff23\uff21\uff29\uff13\uff10\uff12\uff2d\uff2b\u69cb\u9020_eng.docx", "file_type": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document", "file_size": 197019, "creation_date": "2025-08-15", "last_modified_date": "2025-08-15"}, "hash": "884e110f65af94908bce267b6fe0496b51cb442c0543e5b3e59b58348c44f49b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "818ad9b1-5cb3-4ebe-9077-ff78e1518dca", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_name": "\uff2a\uff23\uff21\uff29\uff13\uff10\uff12\uff2d\uff2b\u69cb\u9020_eng.docx", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Admin\\Desktop\\Advanced-RAG\\MergingCode\\data\\\uff2a\uff23\uff21\uff29\uff13\uff10\uff12\uff2d\uff2b\u69cb\u9020_eng.docx", "file_type": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document", "file_size": 197019, "creation_date": "2025-08-15", "last_modified_date": "2025-08-15"}, "hash": "5cbc329aedb0b3ece38605712d167bb37246e00bee047d82280b4bf0170bc2f6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "4": {"node_id": "39f5f718-a544-486f-b99e-7ae9deed5b11", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_name": "\uff2a\uff23\uff21\uff29\uff13\uff10\uff12\uff2d\uff2b\u69cb\u9020_eng.docx", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Admin\\Desktop\\Advanced-RAG\\MergingCode\\data\\\uff2a\uff23\uff21\uff29\uff13\uff10\uff12\uff2d\uff2b\u69cb\u9020_eng.docx", "file_type": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document", "file_size": 197019, "creation_date": "2025-08-15", "last_modified_date": "2025-08-15"}, "hash": "28736af3d649bf710794cfee0f43d1da9631bf6d0fa1a37b598535c36c148bff", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Scandinavian Airlines CEO Jan Carlsson: \" Moment of Truth\"\n\nof Truth Of Truth\n\nFrontline employees are told that the 15 seconds of customer service they receive can determine the success of a company.\n\nThe moment of truth is 15 seconds.
